            "Maybe I missed something in this movie, but I thought it was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite some time. At least for adults. True, there were a few cute jokes, but how many jokes can be done at the expense of the panda being fat and flabby before the audience, even children, say Okay, we got it. The theater was about 2/3 full and for most of this movie people were getting up to leave; adults and children. A man a few seats down was snoring, which was one of the more entertaining aspects of this movie. Some of the dialogue was muddled and some of the action so fast it was hard to keep up and not get a headache. It had a nice basic plot, which was okay, but there were aspects of this movie that were not fully developed, and this included character development. For example, when Po asks his dad if he's really his dad (since the dad was a duck). I would have liked to see more development of the main characters, other than Hoffman's, as that would have at least added something to the movie for the adults. And apparently not too many kids liked this movie either, at least on the day we went, since throughout the entire movie they were talking, and not about the movie. And for the most part, the voices for each character fit, but Black's voice for Po just did not work well for the personality for the character on screen. It seemed like Black was holding back, which is too bad, since, like Robin Williams, for example, you let them go and what comes out is pure magic. Even in animation and the dialogue is more scripted.\n",
            "My wife and I watched the Blu-Ray DVD of Kung Fu Panda for 30 minutes but could not take any more of it. This is, without doubt, one of the absolute worst animated features we have ever seen. It's a real snoozer -- not the least bit funny or entertaining.<br/><br/>So much top-notch talent was wasted on the weak storyline and pathetically bad dialog! It's hard to believe that this second-rate production came from Dreamworks Animation, the studio that created the fabulous Shrek. The animation is mediocre and seems amateurish in comparison to any Shrek feature or Pixar film of the past decade (Nemo, Cars, Wall-E, Ratatouille, Monsters Inc., Toy Story, etc.).<br/><br/>Save your time and money - not this unfunny Panda. Take a nap instead.\n",
            "I could only watch half of this movie, then I had to call it quits for me and my daughter. Imagine teaching children to prejudge and ridicule people based on looks. The panda looks like the panda is SUPPOSED to look, and he stands there and accepts the poking and prodding and ridicule that is heaped upon him and it made me sad to watch. If the Panda were female or if he were a caricature of a visible minority, jokes of the same ilk would be inexcusable, so how is this funny? I'm sick to death of this trite perpetuation of a stereotype that, at best, teaches children forget that there is a broad range of what is beautiful, or, indeed, what is healthy.'There is evidence that fat people who achieve cardiovascular fitness through exercise have better health outcomes than lean people who don't.' Many people are overweight. Many people think that being fit means being lean. We have to stand this idea on its head and film and TV would be a powerful way to get these ideas across to the burgeoning generation, instead, we perpetuate cruelty and a culture where eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, ranging between 5-15% for patients with anorexia and 1-2% for those with bulimia; where people with these eating disorders have the potential for imminent and serious self-harm (those with anorexia are 57 times more likely to commit suicide than the expected rate for women in the same age/racial groupings). Time for Hollywood to behave more responsibly.\n",

            "This may not be the worst movie I've ever seen. I am surprised to see those \"good\" ratings and comments. What is good about this movie? actions? music? cliché words? special effects? the crane's meticulous feather? You can find them in any other animations. Probably this one could have been called good if it had been made thirty years ago. This is simply one of those products from Hollywood's product line. The director tried to make it special by putting a panda as the hero. Yet that makes no difference. The panda and his father and his teacher and his colleague and his neighbors, they are just as same as those character you can find in every other dreamwork's stuff. Sorry. The first one they made was glorious, the second one was a movie, the third one was just a piece of junk. This would be a sign of the end of road if their films went on like this. Or a culture bomb to make people idiots.\n",
            "OK. I shall keep this short, and sweet (?).<br/><br/>There's no \"Ifs\", \"Ands\", or \"Buts\" about it - Kung Fu Panda stank.<br/><br/>I hated, absolutely hated, Po the Panda. (It should have been \"Poop\" the Panda!) It really figures that Po's voice belonged to that totally unfunny nincompoop, Jack Black.<br/><br/>As far as \"so-called\" light-hearted, family entertainment goes - Kung Fu Panda, on a whole, was flat, uninspired, predictable, empty-headed, and utterly stupid.<br/><br/>Yes - You, of course, may not agree with what I've said here. And, hey, that's OK. But do keep in mind, this movie really irked me off, especially for the time that I wasted watching it. And, at this point, I think that I've made myself quite clear and I shouldn't feel the need to explain the \"why\" of every single statement that I've made.\n",
            "Out of all the atrocious things I could spend my time on this \"film\" was the worst possible thing. If there's any person who would say that this is their favourite movie, I would like to bonk them in the head. I did not laugh once at any of the lines. We get it, Po is fat, but the movie recycles that joke again and again and again. The animation is standard at best, it does not shine nor could it be considered beautiful. The villain is average, the plot is very archetypal and the action scenes are boring. I left the theatre stiff. I only wish that less movies were like this and more like the classic \"Jurassic World.\" <br/><br/>Thank you good night\n",

            "Cartoons are typically targeted towards the younger audience. The impressionable minds, the sponges. So instead of making a movie which teaches that hard work, sustained commitment, discipline and patience ultimately pays off, here, we have the exact opposite. The team who has spent a lifetime preparing for a task is pushed aside in favor of a wholly unmotivated, ill-prepared, unqualified on all accounts \"hero\", who is chosen by destiny (which fairy tale could do without it ?) and conveyed through a turtle, who is about to kick the bucket himself.<br/><br/>In matter of two days, a panda who is so overweight that he literally cannot get up, and could (or should) keel over from a massive stroke or a heart-attack any minute, is sharpened into a Master Kung-Fu fighter through a program of --consuming chicken dumplings.<br/><br/>It's a frightening message for the younger generation: That unqualified and unprepared triumphs over the qualified and prepared, by goofing off. Panda has no inherent special powers in him. No gifts are bestowed upon him to make him special. He just becomes special because he believes he's special. Wow.<br/><br/>I will say that there is nothing visually wrong in the way this movie is put together. The animation, direction and voice overs are all first-rate. My beef is with the central premise of the movie, which is why, I feel, kids should not be exposed to it.\n",
            "I hate the idea behind this movie, which is that it doesn't matter how hard you work or train; its all about fate and destiny. You can be a mediocre but if you are the chosen one, don't worry, you will not only surpass everybody else but you will be the best. Tell this to every athlete and see what his response will be. Our kids should learn that to make a difference in sports, you must work hard, train hard, eat well. You will not win a medal just because you horoscope says so. In the movie, although the hero trains and works at last, it will not match the years and whole life dedication of training that other members of the team have. So the movie has a very bad moral teaching.\n",
            "From the technical standpoint, it's excellent.<br/><br/>From the point of the idea it promotes - it's disgusting. What's the idea? To succeed, you don't have to work hard. Just be a good guy, have good heart, overcome yourself, and you will win and succeed in no time more than 5 superstars who were working in this area for years.<br/><br/>This is patented politically-correct American ideology: professionalism is not important; communication skills are. Work on your soul a little bit, and you will achieve what you want.<br/><br/>In fact, it's \"Forrest Gump\" for kids. The idiot has an inherent advantage. The smart and capable will always trip in the critical moment, and the idiot will win.<br/><br/>What does it teach the kids? you don't have to work hard. No need to spend years on training and polishing your skills. No need to be smart. Just be a good guy, be at the right place in the right moment, and the rest will come.<br/><br/>I actually have left with my kid form the middle of the movie - I didn't want him to be spoiled by this ideology.\n",
            "Might be fine for younger kids who haven't seen this same plot 100 different times. But I had to give up 30 minutes in.<br/><br/>Po is a clumsy fool (picture Inspector Clouseau) with a good heart, somehow destined to become a hero and protect the world from an imprisoned villain who's apparently so dangerous that all the guards and kung fu experts in the rest of China can't handle him.<br/><br/>When the wise old master selects Po to be the new \"dragon warrior\", the headmaster of the famous kung fu school is outraged, planning to force Po out of training by any means necessary.<br/><br/>That's the first 30 minutes. Now really, how many adults reading this don't already know how the story plays out? Cute slapstick, though.\n",
            "3\n",
            "I found Kung Fu Panda to be rather boring and very typical. The plot has been done many times and the other times it were done better. I also found the jokes and gags in this film to be way too childish and immature. I know its meant for children and younger teens but this film just didn't seem that great, and it also sends a rather bad message. Kung Fu Panda brings us absolutely nothing new. Perhaps it's me getting older, but the humor nowadays feels very shallow in these animated movies. And the almost non-stop violence, because there really is. I don't mind action movies, or even martial arts movies but this is clearly a movie with intended major demographics in ages 8-12, and hopefully a sizeable number of high school kids so the music and animation must be perfected. The characters were okay. Jack Black was the right choice for Po, along with the other cast but overall the film was for the most part plain boring.\n",
            "There's a conspiracy around the world! I kid you not! Apparently me and my family saw some different version of the Kung Fu Panda movie than the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, reading the other comments assured me of the opposite. At least the plot and special effects/kung fu combats, mentioned by everyone else, seem just the same.<br/><br/>Look, I really liked the main idea of\" there's no secret ingredient\", which, by the way, was pretty obvious to me from the start. But throwing it in as a mere side note, instead of building a good story around this comfortably familiar (though redundant) concept, was a pretty lame idea.<br/><br/>The whole movie feels like a 5-minute silly and funny at some parts TV gag stretched for the entire hour and a half - no character development, including the main hero, not a single fresh idea (which could be forgivable sometimes, but no redeeming value here) - just wonderfully executed kung fu fights. So, if you're a fan of those - you'd be pretty satisfied. In case, you're not - you won't.<br/><br/>I was really hoping this movie has something under its sleeve, as some first facial exchanges between the two old masters took place, yet, ultimately, they had no special meaning at all. And while we saw a dubbed Russian version, I really can't understand why would anyone hire such a star-studded English cast for voicing a few lines for absolutely unneeded kung fu masters characters. I doubt Angelina Jolie's or Jacki Chan's voices could do any difference here.<br/><br/>Not to mention, that this whole idea of \"a simple good guy\" who comes and succeeds at what fail the long-time experts for absolutely no understandable reason (apparently learning all the principles in one day because he wanted to get some dumplings) - look, it really starts to get on my nerves. Really.\n",
            "There's just so much money involved in the creation of the current breed of animated/cg movies that they rarely strike out. Indeed, I found even mediocrely-reviewed fare such as \"monsters vs aliens\" to actually be quite good and appreciable on an adult level with lots of intelligent jokes and the occasional innuendo.<br/><br/>But not \"Kung Fu Panda.\" Kung Fu Panda is awful.<br/><br/>Here's the plot: fat, lazy, wisecracking panda boy is surprisingly chosen to be \"the one\" to defend against big bad guy, much to the chagrin of five sidekick kung-fu master animals who have spent their lifetimes in training and work. initially, they reject him since he's a fat lazy panda. will he find the solution, a combination of 'believing in himself' and taking advantage of his 'alternate but just as good talents' (he's fat, so he can be motivated by food) to defeat the bad guy and save the day? alas, yes. the plot is just that stupid, sending all the wrong messages. in kung fu panda's America, you don't have to do the math or practice for more than a few token montage scenes. you just 'believe in yourself.' this line of nonsense used to what they used to console kids on the slow bus with, but is now what passes for 'inclusive education' or some-such. and mind you, I'm an extreme political liberal (though a well educated one) writing this.<br/><br/>but, even such inanity could be salvageable if the jokes and acting along the way were any good. they're not. the A-list quality supporting voice talent in addition to B-list quality lead Jack Black are utterly miscast. Angelina Jolie is wasted and unnecessary, though I'm sure she was glad for the check for her afternoon of work. did anybody here go see the movie because Angelina Jolie or Dustin Hoffman were cast? then why did they bother? one suspects a massive kickback scheme is in place - how else to explain why major stars land well paying voice animated rolls that probably do nothing to drawing audiences? the only good to be gotten out of this absolutely miserable movie are the fight scenes. i'm not usually one for fight scenes (and this movie didn't change this), but at times they were clever enough. there was no groundbreaking animation in this movie; I just mean to say that if you happen to like kung fu fight scenes, then you'll probably enjoy the ones here. i personally found those in 'crouching tiger hidden dragon' far more satisfying, but I can't say that those here were in any way bad for what they were. the 'dumpling scene' was particularly well done.<br/><br/>the only thing that this movie had that in any way broke the usual stereotypes was the depiction of the prison that held the 'long caged' bad guy in the beginning. his jailers, for once, were not total dupes.<br/><br/>i, however, felt like a total dupe after watching this very poor movie - doubly so since it was recommended to me as being particularly well written.<br/><br/>conclusion: worst animated/cgi film i've seen in at least the last decade.\n",
            "As a teenager, I had a choice to choose which movie to watch with my girlfriend the next morning. So I diligently went online to see the IMDb rankings for the two movies. Firstly Don't Mess With The Zohan and secondly Kung Fu Panda. Based on the ratings and reviews I chose to see kung Fun Panda, it seemed the better choice.... It seemed the keyword.<br/><br/>So when I eventually went to see it, you could say I was a little let down. Actually you could say an enormous amount. To make matters worse, I was surrounded by children, normally tolerant of them, today I was not. They laughed at inappropriate jokes, scenes which were clearly not even funny. I contemplated \"when will this end?\" \"It must be shortly\" This movie is clearly not as comical as Shrek or Ice Age, it did not have witty, enchanting characters. Since when does a goose or duck give birth to a panda? There should be more factual, intellectual movies for children to see in the holidays! The only good thing was the imagery and advancement in realistic cartoons. I was more than relieved when it ended, I WANT MY $10.80 BACK!\n",

            "Truth be told - I don't like Dreamworks/Pixar movies. Some are better, some are worse but for me it usually feels like watching the same formula again and again, only this time with a panda/robot/fish/ant/crap protagonist. I would skip Kung-Fu Panda easily, but whad'ya know, the \"making of\" was rather interesting, which made me ignore my tingling spider-sense and giving it a try. Truth be told - the movie looks very good (as expected), and I'm a sucker for these marvelous 2d animation eye-candies which seems to be popping around in those 3d movies. And so the animation is great, the character design is inspiring and everything Appears to be working out well. Well - too bad looks ain't enough in order to make a movie. it might suffice for a screen saver, a poster or even a rather interesting \"making of\", but that's as far as it goes. Sadly most of the plot is rather dull, same old jokes, same all goofy animal who just doesn't seem to find its place, but hey, polls and statistics claims that about 50% of western children are overweight to obese. Most of them have broken dreams of becoming things they can never be, so why not selling them the illusion that any fat loser can be the \"Supreme Dragon Fighter\"? Pack a few lame jokes along the way, and you're good to go. Usually in similar films when the clueless loser is supposed to undergo a path that will make him the ultimate hero, he either practices and improves or finds out about some \"magic quality\" he had within himself all along. In this movie, the makers of the movie didn't bother themselves to make a choice, so the Panda hero easily shifts between the options, not really qualifying for any of them. He gets better and seems to know stuff even though he had almost no time to practice, and when that doesn't suffice he suddenly turns into \"fat people don't get hurt, only bounce your attacks back with their fat\" mode. Such behavior could have been tolerated farther if the jokes or the plot would cover up for it, but they don't.<br/><br/>This entire movie... no, the entire 3d \"family action comedies\" genre (or whatever name the studios choose to call them) seems to be repeatedly chewing, then puking itself, and so on and so on. Rather sad (sad, you see, not funny) if you think of all the talented artists and animators who do a great job, but are forced to dance to the rotten melody of untalented, uninspired impotent directors and writers.<br/><br/>This movie manages to get 4/10, solely due to its looks and visuals.\n",
            "It never fails to amaze me how lame American animated movies tend to be. Maybe it's because I've been an anime otaku for so long (since washed-out bootlegs in the original Japanese- sans subtitles- were first offered up at comic book conventions for ridiculously high prices), or maybe because I grew up on the likes of ASTRO BOY and JONNY QUEST (which were both aimed at kids whose sensibilities weren't of the Special Needs variety), but the current crop of Big Budget cgi cartoons (including those that blend the cgi with live-action characters, like TRANSFORMERS and the two FANTASTIC FOUR fiascos) leave me numb. Perhaps because I've also been a martial arts movie fan for most of my life, I was looking forward to KUNG FU PANDA. My own KUNG FU CATS (which also featured a hero named Po) was available for quite some time online (at fanboycomics.biz)- until the site went down- but it certainly wasn't written down to the video game level of KUNG FU PANDA. Anyone fed up with this kind of slap-in-the-face stupidity should check out some of the aforementioned anime (Japanese animation).\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda (2008): Dir: John Stevenson, Mark Osborne / Voices: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan: Disappointing animation about reaching full potential, which is something this overrated animation never does. Simple plot regards panda Po dreaming of becoming a Kung Fu fighter. When he is accidentally deemed Dragon Master his master sets about to prove him unskilled. For starters, being part of this film should be deemed unskilled enough. Chalk full of stereotypes and clichés with only the animated images to shine. Directed by John Stevenson and Mark Osborne who oversee the colourful images. Only Jack Black as Po really comes alive. He is a dreamer whose dreams are met but the idea of facing off against the snow leopard is something predicted long before it happens. Dustin Hoffman as the Yoda-like Kung Fu master is tiring. How many miniature creatures sporting wise words have to be Kung Fu teachers? Angelina Jolie as Tigress wants to move ahead thus she will have issues with Po that will evaporate when he proves himself. Ian McShane voices the tyrant villain whose destiny is to escape prison and beat up every Kung Fu warrior save for Po who will save the day. Iother characters are flat but the wildlife references make for a great evening of watching Animal Planet. Satire of Kung Fu films with a playful take on violence aimed at wrong audience. Score: 4 ½ / 10\n",
            "KUNG FU PANDA is a Dreamworks animation whose plot you can guess from the title alone. It's predictable stuff for sure, child-friendly but without possessing that spark of magic that the old Disney films used to have. The plot is hackneyed and appears to have been written by a team of computers, as content as it is to revisit all the old tropes and cliches and attempting to put a fresh spin on them. Imagine every Asian film cliche in Hollywood packed into a single movie and you'll get some idea of what this is like. A talented voice cast (the annoying Jack Black aside) can't compensate for this generic nonsense.\n",
            "I never was taken much with Kung Fu Panda as with a lot of reviewers on here. Dreamworks have come up with some pretty impressive animations over the years though my favourites being Shrek 1 and 2. But the company just isn't in the same league as Pixar. Anyway Kung Fu Panda I found mildly enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying. Don't get me wrong I chuckled at a few parts throughout and Jack Black puts in an incredible effort of bringing a lot of charm to Po. The cast is great including Black with Dustin Hoffman (Shifu), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Jackie Chan (Monkey), Seth Rogen (Mantis) and Lucy Lui (Viper). They all lend good voice-overs to the characters and even the story was OK. <br/><br/>But I couldn't connect with many of the characters, the fight sequences if you can call them that were choreographed surprisingly badly, the script wasn't sharp enough with the comedy as the jokes weren't all that funny and the animation wasn't as impressive as previous animations. Despite that though it's not the worst animation I've seen and it was at least trying to entertain you and the bottom line is kids will absolutely love it anyway. But it's not a movie I would care to watch again.\n",
            "When Kung Fu Panda was released in China, it was praised not only for the production values but its faithfulness to Chinese culture. Suddenly people in China were asking, how can an American production company outdo their Chinese counterparts in creating an animated film that sends such a positive message about China and gets everything right? It's akin to the Russians who launched the first man into space, only to see the American overtake them, eventually landing a man on the moon. For many Chinese critics, Kung Fu Panda is the American 'first lunar landing' of animated martial arts movies. <br/><br/>But if the Chinese critics only had a bit of critical acumen, they could easily see there's nothing to be jealous about here. Sure there's a great amount of respect for Chinese culture seen throughout the film (down to the last Chinese character in the credits) as well as some sensational animation including the opening anime 'dream' sequence as well as that incredibly difficult feat of having tons of realistic looking confetti pour down at the Kung Fu tournament where the Kung Fu Panda, Po, is crowned Dragon Warrior. But how is Chinese culture honored by turning Chinese people into a bunch of goofy, self-effacing anthropomorphic animals? Surely kids under eight will dig it, but adults? I hardly think so.<br/><br/>While the directors of 'Panda' are firmly ensconced in the world of martial arts and action adventure films, they are neophytes when it comes to comedy. It all comes down to one silly slapstick scene after another emphasizing Po as a good natured, bumbling fool with a decided inferiority complex. Whether he fails getting up the steps into the arena for the Kung Fu tournament, or shoots himself high into the air strapped to a bunch of fireworks and then unceremoniously falling straight down and landing inside the arena, only to be crowned Dragon Warrior, the idea that we should fall in love with his lovable loser is spelled out from the beginning and repeated ad infinitum. How many times do we have to see Po chucked around like an inflatable doll whether it's by Master Shifu, Villain Tai Lung or when he finds himself caught inside the mechanical torture chamber, a device that Shifu's Dragon Warrior candidates, 'The Furious Five', in contrast, have mastered.<br/><br/>I do confess that Master Shifu's 'epiphany' in realizing that he has to train Po in a different way so that he can succeed as the dragon warrior, might have been the most clever moment in the comic arc of the film. And certainly Po's transformation from self-effacing masochist to gleeful aggressor as he embraces his 'appetite', is a welcome plot twist after being subjected to the one joke idea of Po as a bumbling clown. Yes, there's finally a method to Po's madness, as Tai Lung is unable to harness Po's new found manic energy. It's sort of like a dominant major league batter unable to master the completely unpredictable path of a knuckle ball. <br/><br/>But if we view Po as representing a grownup who still acts like a kid with the particularly bad habit of overeating, then the message 'be yourself', should fall on deaf ears. In this day where smart educators are trying to control the epidemic of childhood obesity, Po's unbridled enthusiasm for that extra cupcake, would not lead to his triumph as dragon warrior. It's a wishful conceit on the part of the directors that Po would end up victorious in his confrontation with the evil Tai Lung. The filmmakers' message to kids here is be happy even if you don't treat yourself well. And things will turn out alright even if you've made no effort to change yourself.<br/><br/>As for the action adventure aspect of 'Panda', I can't help it if it seems that the 'holy trinity' of Shifu, Oogway and Tai Lung, are pilfered straight out of the Star Wars play book. Shifu appears to be a Yoda stand-in with the wise, all-knowing tortoise Oogway, reprising the Obi-Wan Kenobi role (Oogway appears to employ his own version of 'The Force' as he is responsible for turning the slight Red Panda Master Shifu into a powerhouse). Finally, Tai Lung can go toe to toe with Darth Vadar any day as both have no problems mixing erudition with brute force.<br/><br/>A good deal of 'Panda' is taken up by one Kung Fu sequence after another and you really have to be a martial arts fan to be enamored with all those repetitious action sequences. Less bothersome (but still silly) was the decision to make Po's father, Mr. Ping, a goose. There's also the Wuxi Finger Hold that leads to Tai Lung's destruction (at first it seems like a nuclear explosion but it really is a clearing out of 'bad energy' or 'bad karma'). Finally, The 'Furious Five' are not distinct enough as characters despite the conscription of such luminaries as Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan to perform the voice overs. <br/><br/>I think 'Kung Fu Panda' would have been a better film had the films' scenarists decided from the outset not to make Po into such a hapless buffoon. That would have also probably meant that the sentimental Mr. Ping and his love for noodles had to go too. In its present incarnation, Kung Fu Panda is certainly suitable for kids (although Tai Lung's antics might be too strong a draught for children under eight). As for adults, ignore the dopey screenplay and concentrate on the visuals and the music, which certainly deserve the accolades already garnered throughout the film community since the film's release in 2008.\n",

This one was entertaining but forgettable.<br/><br/>The story has no surprises at all. Po is named the Chosen One. Po trains to fight bad guy, initially frustrating crotchety trainer but ultimately winning him over. Po fights bad guy and wins. That's it. That's the whole story.<br/><br/>You'd think with a story that thin there'd be lots of room for character development. But there wasn't. There were a lot of pratfalls. Jack Black improvised the occasional bit of funny dialogue, but there weren't a lot of laughs in my theater. The Furious Five characters had no personalities at all. The villain was villainous in the most familiar and boring way possible. <br/><br/>Visually, the movie had some nice moments. The fight scenes were fun to watch. I really enjoyed the villain's escape from a very impressive prison. I also liked the look of the turtle Master. And the scene in which Po is trained to become great at kung fu using his desire to eat a dumpling was great. But overall the movie was unsatisfying.\n",
            "Well here we go with another CG animated movie full of cutesy animals. Will it be any good or will it be simply average like so many of its competitors (only Pixar produce consistent gems). Well I went in to this movie with high hopes having read a positive review in 'Empire' and the fact that I was viewing the movie in IMAX would surely help. Well unfortunately not. This is just an average movie where everything is well done but no connection was made with the characters on my behalf. Admittedly most of the children in the audience seemed to enjoy the film (but I felt even they would of enjoyed it more). The animation is strong though I found the fight scenes a bit like watching a computer game. But I just was not taken with any of the characters and the main character of the Panda just did not do it for me, there was just too much Jack Black here and not enough character. The films ends with an inevitable conclusion and although by no means a bad movie it would take a lot for me to watch this again.\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is a cool-looking movie, and fun, and unlike many summer movies, it did not annoy or offend me. So yeah, I'm sort of glad that I saw it.<br/><br/>That said, though, I would've appreciated a more original script. As it stands, Kung Fu Panda feels like it was cobbled together from the leftovers of 100 other movies involving chosen warriors, sagely mentors, crises of confidence and spooky supervillains. I recognized scenes lifted from Star Wars, from various karate movies, and even from the long-forgotten (or so I thought) Judge Dredd! This is not exactly a trailblazing film, in other words.<br/><br/>Also, I actually disapproved of Kung Fu Panda's underlying message about always \"following your dream,\" even if it's (a) utterly implausible and (b) involves telling your family to buzz off. You see, at the start of the film, the panda is working in his dad's noodle shop, but he dreams of being a karate master - even though he's lazy and fat. So, in order to become the hero, the panda has to reject his father's life's work and, through no particular effort of his own, become a super-powerful warrior.<br/><br/>Call me Mr. Cranky-Pants, but I think that message might actually be bad for little kids. The film, in short, tells kids to be dissatisfied with ordinary jobs - like working in a restaurant - and encourages them to pursue ridiculous unlikely jobs, like unstoppable warrior hero. It annoys me, really, that hundreds of Hollywood movies are all about vaulting over ordinary people (like the panda's dad) in order to make it big. Foreign films, you'll notice, don't always have this \"become a rock star\" message, and are actually about realistic things and realistic people. But not American movies, noooo...American movies tell you that you can become a karate master without exercise and leave your boring dad and his boring everyday job in the dust.<br/><br/>Right, enough ranting. I suppose I've been spoiled by watching too many foreign movies lately, and I can no longer get behind cute formula fiction like Kung Fu Panda. That doesn't mean I hated this movie. The animation was nice, the action was cool, the celebrity voices impressed. I just wish that a single original idea - or even a shred of realism - had been displayed as well.\n",
            "I watched this movie on the recommendation of a good friend. He absolutely loved this movie and as he hasn't steered me wrong before, I took his word for it and watched it. Boy did he let me down on this one. I will state the films' positives first.<br/><br/>The animation is gorgeous. It is a visual gold mine and on every level the movie looks FANTASTIC. Here endeth the positives.<br/><br/>And now for the negatives-<br/><br/>EVERYTHING ELSE about the film. Where do I start? How about Jack Black's character stumbling or falling down every two minutes of the film. This gimmick is so tired in children's films. The goofy, ugly duckling character bumping into a table and then starting a chain reaction of things falling apart around him and then he falls on his ass and something lands on his head has been used ad nauseum in most films like this. The plot, the script, and the characters are so thin that there is zero emotional impact when the villain and Kung Fu Panda meet in the finale. There is no sense of danger whatsoever in regard to the villain. WARNING HERE BE SPOILERS All of the characters are freaking out all through the movie that the villain (a completely wasted effort from the fantastic Ian McShane) is going to kill everybody. He kills no one and Kung Fu Panda dispatches him easily in the end. Which, considering that KFP has zero Karate skill until a montage gives it to him is laughable. Every Disney cliché you can think of is on display here-from the Ugly Duckling to the goofy supporting characters to the \"Just believe in yourself\" pep talks from the wiser older characters. Basically the film feels like all the money went into the animation and not the script and plot. This is a shame because there is no solid foundation for the films' breath-taking visuals to rest on. There is just no meat to this movie. Take away the visual side and you have a completely un-imaginative film that teaches the viewer nothing and elicits zero emotional response.\n",
            "I will admit, I am not a fan of animated films, but this movie was not very entertaining even considering that. The story was silly and the jokes bland, and the progression of the story was very lazy. The only thing that I thought that was cool about the movie were the action sequences with the bad \"guy\" in the movie. Otherwise, this movie was certainly worth passing, unless you have children that are entertained by just about anything animated. Jack Black is typically very funny to me, and this character even suited his voice, yet still the silly and mundane story line just wasn't enough to keep my attention. You will enjoy a few laughs here and there, but in the end I think it is likely you will feel relatively dissatisfied altogether.\n",
            "Kung fu Panda was nominated for Best animated film of the year in 2008. Why? I didn't like it. There isn't much plot. I felt like there weren't many laughs. Sure the kids ate it up but that's cause kids are stupid. They loved Alvin and the Chipmunks, Aliens in the attic, G-force. Besuides Alvin, which wasn't that good, the other films were just awful.<br/><br/>Now days when I hear that an animated film is Dreamworks or something other than Pixar, I am going to assume it's not perfection. Beside Shrek. That was a great film. Kung fu Panda is definitely not.<br/><br/>The cast to this movie is great. and sure it has a couple of laughs and visuals are nice. But the plot and film itself just isn't that great. It's an overrated movie. I mean I never wanted to watch it. After I had heard it was good though, I thought\"well, what the hell\" and watched it. Though not awful, not good either. Skip it. I didn't like it.<br/><br/>Kung fu Panda: C+\n",
            "On the plus side, I admired the realistic computer-generated fur effects. This animating technology really is coming of age. On the minus side, I'm still wondering about the merits of a movie in which the over-weight 'hero' is motivated by offering him food. First, I have a concern about, well, not only Hollywood's but society in general's tendency to make fun of fat people. I guess the filmmakers could argue that the panda is just over-weight to him an unlikely hero.. and then of course if he were to become slimmer to be accepted that's not cool either. But couldn't the panda just be fat and that's that? Couldn't he have been motivated by something other than more food? The bottom line is, the story is kinda OK but nothing special. My kids liked it but I was left wanting more.\n",
            "I see, that most of the people who have seen this film rate is sky-high, I just can't understand why. Sure, it's not a bad movie, but far from great. In a time when not many truly re-watchable cartoons come out - max. one every year - it's not hard to be number one. Others have written down the story, so I won't do so, I someone would not know, one can read it from there. First of all I don't get it why is it a must to use big-time Hollywood actors as voices for characters? Voice acting is acting too, I know, but surely others could of been used as well. I just don't believe in a movie promotion campaign where the strategy is based on the voice-actors, not on the movie itself. Onwards, why do the animated figures have to look like the people giving voices to them? Couldn't the snake be less-lu-like and the opossum less-Hoffman-like? This going to all the characters. Further more, I don't get why were there five big kung fu masters (appart from the trivial reason, that there - as it seems - are five styles named after them)? There just is no reason for it in the movie, no characters are drawn, all are totally dissed. It would of been enough to make two others and the movie would of worked just fine. In this case the two others would of gotten more character and charisma; a bit of more personality. Currently the ape, the insect and the legless-lizard are totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>Even I don't like the way the panda wins in the end, I see it's the only child-friendly-Hollywood-way, so be it. The movie is watchable once, with a few funny moments, a decent story and a touch of drama; even some sort of a moral message for the youth. For this the movie gets points. However - in my opinion - some more character work the picture would score higher. The only figures I am satisfied are the turtle and the opossum (the semi-master). Even the panda would need more. The animation and the drawing is a work of the pros... but hey, we are talking about a major Hollywood studio, so it's what they do, and they are quite good at it.\n",
            "I'm deliberately rating this below what my mind insists I rate it because FLAIR DOES NOT MAKE A GOOD MOVIE! This movie is dripping with style. The atmosphere is pitch perfect, hyper real, and beautiful as a cherry blossom. Fighting sequences are flawlessly choreographed, and characters are hilarious and make expressions so subtle they deserve academy awards. Only one thing mars all this. THE MOVIE ISN'T ABOUT ANYTHING. If you don't believe me, wait till the plot-twist at the end that states the moral aloud, and crazily enough is that the secret to success is NOTHING. If you believe in something enough it apparently comes true...in the magical fantasy world of Kung Fu Panda. This moral idea of a person being able to will themselves to greatness is not only dangerous applied to real life (I can fly!) but the movie contradicts the message itself, by making the villain evil because he is selfish and a killer. Apparently it's bad when the snow leopard 'believes in himself' enough to fight for what's his, but if the Panda does it it gives him mystical powers. Also, the Panda is implied to have KILLED the leopard at the end, using the very power taught to him by the leopard's surrogate father. Good lesson there, eh? Skadoosh. As very pretty screen-savers go, this film is at least better written then Clone Wars, but equally devoid of likable characters and substance. Much like I'd recommend Clone Wars to people who love awesome battles and technical wizardry but can afford to sit through something inherently empty, if you like to watch top notch CG, some great pratfalls, and kung fu fighting animals and you can stand no character development, moral, rhyme or reason, watch Kung Fu Panda once. Then you can go read a good book or watch The Dark Knight to fill the emptiness left behind.\n",
            "First, let me say my niece enjoyed the movie quite a bit...this was her first movie so it was a new experience for her. If I was rating the movie on her thoughts on it I would have rated it higher. However, I paid money to see this one too, and I have to say I just thought it would be funnier. Jack Black is great as the voice of the Panda as was all the cast, though I thought the five warriors were rather ignored for the most part with the Tigress one sort of stepping up a bit. The movie was just to talky for me with way to many serious moments. I will draw a parallel if I may. The first hour of Shrek had me laughing a bit and was rather good. The last half hour I did not laugh much at all and I thought it dragged down the rest of the film. This whole movie seemed more like the last half hour of Shrek rather than the first hour. It had a few cute parts here and there, but for me it just did not deliver the goods, the preview for Madagascar 2 looked better than this one. The story has a Panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu hero ending up being the chosen dragon warrior to the dismay of a master of kung fu and his students. A villain escapes and is on his way to challenge the dragon warrior and nothing to surprising happens along the way. A few chuckles to be sure in the ending fight, and scattered throughout the movie, just not enough for my tastes. However, my niece loved it so it is a good movie for kids anyway.\n",
            "I saw a trailer and maybe a few clips of this cartoon film and thought it looked like it would be fun, I didn't see it at the cinema, but I wasn't going to miss it when I got the opportunity. Basically Po (Jack Black) is the lazy tongue-in-cheek slacker giant panda, and he is the biggest fan of Kung Fu, but his (adoptive) father the Chinese goose Zeng (Dan Fogler) wants him to keep working at his family noodle shop. After trying to watch his favourite kung fu team, the legendary Furious Five: Tigress the South China tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross); Po falls into the arena and it looks like he is unintentionally chosen as the one to fulfil the ancient prophecy. Oogway the Galápagos tortoise (Randall Duk Kim) says he is correct about his choice of who will become the Dragon Warrior, but Master Shifu the red panda (Dustin Hoffman) is unconvinced, but the panda does study and train alongside his idols. Po and the Furious Five are unaware that the big threat and vengeful former kung fu student to Shifu, Tai Lung the snow leopard (Ian McShane), has escaped captivity and is heading their way. Po meanwhile, despite loving being next to his idols, he also also does not think he is the correct choice as the Dragon Warrior, but after some assurance by Shifu he gains the confidence to complete training. He also gets the chance to see the legendary Dragon Scroll, and after a little while of confusion as to its meaning, being blank and reflective, he feels ready enough to face Tai Lung and defeat him. In the end, after using the secret Wuxi Finger Hold to defeat the villain leopard, Po is praised by his five fellow warriors, Shifu and all of the Valley of Peace, becoming a true kung fu master. Also starring Michael Clarke Duncan as Commander Vachir the Javan Rhinoceros, Wayne Knight as Gang Boss and Tenacious D's Kyle Gass as KG Shaw. Black is really likable as the fat endearing character, and the supporting cast all do well also, the story is easy to follow, and the computer animation is just as good as what we've seen in Shrek and Madagascar, it is suitable and enjoyable for all ages, a fun animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Family Film. Worth watching!\n",
            "The panda is cute but it is not quite famalir with the panda in china chinese pandas are cuter\n",

            "When one goes to see a movie of this nature, it is expected that they will compare it to its peers; Finding Nemo etc. However, I cannot even come close to putting this movie in the same category as Finding Nemo when it comes to ratings. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is an easy 92 minutes, that will not only leave children in hysterics at the good clean humour, but will not leave you fuming at Dreamworks for taking another hour and a half of your life. Jack Black brings a full blown feast of his personality to the table, and Dustin Hoffman does a stellar job as the diminutive kung fu master. Jolie, Liu and Chan hardly feature in this star studded cast. The animation is as good as you expect these days, and the pace of the movie doesn't let anything to be desired.<br/><br/>However, I do have a few bones to pick with this film. One can go see Toy Story and be captured by the notion of figurines coming to life while the human beings are away, or see Finding Nemo and be content with the assumption that all the beings of the ocean can talk to each other - while they still live in sea anemones etc. These movies thrive on these settings to aid and progress the plot of the movie. One has to wonder watching Kung Fu Panda, was there any other point to personifying these animals other than to play on our feelings as to what is 'cute', and sell movie tickets to parents with children? There were little, if any, jokes for older generations, whilst the plot line was nothing but your typical underdog story. In the end, one is reminded to believe in one's self etc... blah blah blah. This is apart from the many many many MANY continuity errors that might or might not irritate you.<br/><br/>So, for the performances by Jack Black and Hoffman, as well the great animation and value for young children in the silly humour, I can give it a 6/10. As far as movies go, this does not measure up as much as other movies in its class, and certainly not as much as other movies in general, and I believe that more care was needed to take this good movie and make it a great one.<br/><br/>Strongly recommended for children and bored adults who think it's cute and funny to see a fat panda try to do Kung Fu - no doubt there will be many of you.\n",
            "Po is a panda (voiced by Jack Black) who dreams of being a kung fu master; however, being a little on the large side and just a waiter in a noodle shop, the chances of him realising this fantasy seem relatively small. But when Po leaves work to witness the selection of the Dragon Warrior (the mighty martial artist who is destined to save the valley from dreadful danger), he somehow finds himself chosen for the position.<br/><br/>Now, with only days before the arrival of the villainous Tai Lung, a powerful snow leopard with destruction on his mind, can Po learn the secrets of kung fu in time and become the hero he so desperately wishes to be?<br/><br/>Although Kung Fu Panda has a lot going for itcool animation, great characters and some wonderful gags (which work particularly well if you're a fan of martial arts movies) I'm going to go against what seems to be the general consensus, and declare that I thought the ending sucked, and spoilt what might have been an otherwise excellent adventure.<br/><br/>Following loads of wonderful action, plenty of laughs, and some mystical mumbo-jumbo about a magical scroll that contains the secret of unimaginable power, Kung Fu Panda turns into a weak morality tale, preaching that real strength comes from belief in oneself. Whilst I think that being confident and comfortable with who you are is a wonderful sentiment, I do think that a positive mental attitude only gets you so far, and that the mighty rhino-bashing Tai Lung would've torn Po a new one! End of.<br/><br/>Some fans argue that Po used his weaknesses (ie., his fat) to his advantage, deflecting his enemy's more powerful moves; others say that after Tai Lung realised that he could not improve his powers through the use of the Dragon Scroll, he lost his confidence. I say 'hogwash!'.<br/><br/>Tai Lung was a highly trained juggernaut of rage who easily fought his way past guards twice as bulky as Po and defeated five of the best warriors in the country (does that sound like someone lacking confidence to you? I don't think so). Po should have been turned into panda paste.<br/><br/>Of course, there is the theory that once Po worked out that he all he needed to do was be himself, he finally realised his destiny and became the fabled Dragon Warrior. If this is the case, then it's a lame, wishy-washy idea that isn't explained very well .<br/><br/>Either way, the ending spoils the film. And that's a real shame.<br/><br/>5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.\n",
            "One perfect way to make Jack Black not too annoying: make him a cute computer-generated panda! Another fun, if not all too predictable film, has Po the Panda, a cook for his father's noodle shop, selected as being the legendary Dragon Warrior, much to the chagrin of five kung-fu artists and their master, who have spent their lives and then some trying to attain that goal.<br/><br/>The movie is entirely predictable. Don't expect something different or unique done to the status quo of computer-generated animation and storytelling. But of that, Kung Fu Panda is much more entertaining than some of the other recent, past efforts, and the quality is above par as well! I found myself not minding Kung Fu Panda. Jack Black's voice is softer than his other films so Po's character isn't your usual Jack Black-like character. Thumbs up for a job well done.\n",
            "I saw KFP last night and i when i left the theatre, there was a weird feeling in my stomach. That feeling was disappointment due to the lack of laughter. I watched the entire movie with a smile on my face, so it was enjoyable but not hysterical, i never broke out in laughter like i did with other animated movies.<br/><br/>This movie has something special and that is the magnificent animation and the spectacular fight scenes, that will remind you of \"crouching tiger,hidden dragon\" and \"house of flying daggers\".<br/><br/>I went to see it with a friend of mine and we both love movies. Afterwards we love to discuss what we saw and re-enjoy the best moments, but you could have heard a pin drop. We couldn't find anything to mention that was memorable to say besides our admiration for the beauty and eastern style the movie was crafted in.<br/><br/>So in conclusion: If you want to see an animated Kungfu-film, KFP is great. If you expect to see a funny picture about a panda doing Kungfu , KFP is very mediocre. 6/10 (the great fighting and lack of comedy)\n",
            "It is not a disaster, but I thought that \"Kung Fu Panda\" was a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>\"Kung Fu Panda\" is big, bright and colourful (and, by the way, looks wonderful in an IMAX DMR print). It does have wonderful animation, some nice comedy sequences and good characters, but \"Kung Fu Panda\" is not nearly as funny as it could have been, and is severely lacking in character.<br/><br/>I think the worst crime of \"Kung Fu Panda\" is the waste of a potentially top class voice cast. Half the fun of modern animated movies, especially for adults, is in the spotting of various celebrity voices having fun. \"Kung Fu Panda\" manages to leech all of the character and idiosyncraticness out of the voices of fine character actors like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and others, that you may as well have used a cast of unknowns.<br/><br/>A real shame, then, but not a total waste. My Nephew (12 years old) liked it. My Niece (11 years old) thought that it was OK.\n",
            "*** SPOILER ALERT ***<br/><br/>To be honest, I think this time Dreamworks surprise me. I really think they delivered one good animated movie with their latest Kung Fu Panda. It was cute, beautifully rendered, and had a lovable characters.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Dreamworks will be Dreamworks and here is why:<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda was fun, sure. But it didn't have something that Dreamworks should work very hard to achieve its goal: a great story. Yes, I know the story was rather 'good', so was the action sequences, the music from Hans Zimmer was enchanting, the China background is spectacular too. But it wasn't enough! <br/><br/>Remember, they compete with the animation giant: Pixar. Maybe the bar was set very high it will be difficult to compete with Pixar. But they should try, although I think this is kind of great for a start.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda tells a story about a fat panda, Po. He was addicted to kungfu. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the 'qualities' for being good at kungfu or any kind of sports (not surprising since he was very fat and slow). Meanwhile, far from Po, one of the most dangerous villain on China - Tai Lung - is escaped from prison. So Oogway, the famous and respectable guru try to gathered all warriors from China to pick one of them to be The Dragon Warrior. Surprisingly to everyone, Po was chosen. Along the way, Po tries so hard to believe in himself and making everyone believe that he - the fat panda - will bring peace to China.<br/><br/>I said I was surprised. Why? From the beginning until the first half of the movie, Kung Fu Panda tells us about one of the most important philosophy in the eastern world: the grand design of the universe. Oogway told everyone that Po was destined to be The Dragon Warrior, and it was not an accident. Simply because 'there was no accident'. Everything in the universe was design in its way that we as a living being couldn't do anything about it but Accept it and Believe in it.<br/><br/>But then, on a second half of the movie it fails to satisfies me. Finally Po believe in himself after he saw the Dragon Scroll. The Dragon Scroll is one and only ancient scroll that only can be seen by the Dragon Warrior itself. And it contains nothing. No words, no moves, only a plain paper that interestingly reflects every face who sees it. Later Po knows that all he could do to beat Tai Lung is to believe in himself. At the end of the story, Po was suddenly learn one of the deadliest move of all time.<br/><br/>How he could learn that moves, is still a mystery to me. After a brief introduction to the eastern philosophy this movie choose a safe, dull, weird ending. What happened to the grand-design-believe-in-yourself-there-was-no-accident thing? Maybe Dreamworks was scared that the 'heavy message' won't reach to the younger audience. But I think they should try harder to make it still believable to your sense.<br/><br/>Overall, Kung Fu Panda fails to satisfies me. But its still one of the funniest summer movie out there. I hope Dreamworks will delivered something magical and smarter next time. Although being alert that Madagascar 2 and Shrek Goes Forth is going along, I just pray for those two won't be another Dreamworks Animation Disaster.<br/><br/>Oh, and Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan were such a waste...\n",
            "\"Kung Fu Panda\" is not one of the great recent animated films. The story is way too predictable, and truth to tell, Po himself didn't overwhelm me with his charisma. But it's elegantly drawn, the action sequences are packed with energy, and it's short enough that older viewers will be forgiving. For the kids, of course, all this stuff is much of a muchness, and here they go again.\n",
            "I have read from many people that pixar makes good stories and then animates them. Dreamworks creates good animation and then makes a story out of it.<br/><br/>I agree with them mostly. Once in a while dreamworks will impress me and make something really good. How to train your dragon, Madagascar and this one are good examples.<br/><br/>Now, I rate this quite low for a \"good\" movie because it just lacks the emotion. It is really cool watching the action shots, but honestly the funny 'cannot open the scroll container' or \"stop right there! wait, let me gain my breath\" epic moment was a bit over done. Yes, it's funny to have the wise turtle say \"I don't know\" when asked who it was going to be. But only play that joke once. They pushed the \"panda is clumsy\" factor way too much.<br/><br/>Don't overdo the humor, and this could get a higher rating.<br/><br/>Also, I honestly don't care WHO the voice actors are, as long as they can make the character become alive.\n",
            "Po, an overweight panda who dreams of becoming a kung-fu master while working at his father's noodle shop finds himself thrusted into the spotlight inadvertently, and selected to be the next Dragon Master, to defeat the evil Tai Lung.<br/><br/>Kung-Fu Panda is a film that is well animated with sections of music which really dramatise the picture. Some of the fights scenes are lavishly and well-applied but it isn't funny and rather predictable. That is the major drawback of Kung-Fu Panda, minor chuckles every now and then.<br/><br/>The film has certainly been influenced by Star-Wars with Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) possibly being a distanced relative of Yoda. There was one comment by Oogway 'There is a saying: yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present' which I actually really liked.<br/><br/>The stand-out voice actor for me was Michael Clarke Duncan as Commander Vachir, which Clarke-Duncan radiates with sheer power and presence.<br/><br/>Kung-Fu Panda has been well created, and although it is not a bad film , which children will no doubt enjoy, it does not create enough laughs for the adult.\n",
            "As a kid, I always loved animals in human roles, and 'Kung Fu Panda' cleverly utilises animal fighting styles into characters- with the exception of Po (the main Panda character). This films starts off quite funny, and goes through the motions of acceptance and all that, but it's narrative is fairly weak, and after awhile, Jack Black's Po got quite annoying. I did like the back-story to Tai Lung (voiced by Ian McShane), but he wasn't as ruthless as he could have been.<br/><br/>With the exception of Michael Clarke Duncan, Seth Rogan, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and Lucy Lui, I seriously didn't recognise the other voice artists until the end credits. I knew I heard the voices before, but I just couldn't pick them, and I'm surprised I didn't notice that it was Dustin Hoffman in the mentor role, and Ian McShane as the villain. They both did a great job! The humour was pretty good, particularly with Po's fan-boy characteristics in the beginning, but his character became more and more annoying as the film progressed, and the whole Dragon Scroll things was a very typical waste of energy that reflects the overall message of the movie. Believe in yourself etc. 'Kung Fu Panda' is not great, but it is not terrible either, and I've had more fun watching other animated films. Bearable at best and panders to childrenumm yeah, bad puns intended! *** out of *****!\n",
            "Beautiful animation, beautiful score, and an awful moral. How can this be made for kids? Is it cool to kill the enemy when he begs for mercy? How was this part of the script not thought over? An eye for an eye and the world will be blind..\n",
            "A family-oriented parody animation, paying homage to the classic martial arts features that clearly inspired it. 'The Karate Kid', 'Enter The Dragon' and even 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' as a more obscure credit. Whilst not at the stylistic level of 'Hero' or 'House of Flying Daggers', there are glimpses of cinematic allurement, yet the basic story and one-dimensional supporting cast of anthropomorphic animals prevented this flick from reading its own omnipotent dragon scroll. In ancient China, a kung fu enthusiastic panda named Po is nominated as the \"Dragon Warrior\" and must fulfil his destiny in vanquishing the antagonistic Tai Lung.<br/><br/>Bravery. Self-belief. \"Skadoosh\". The timeless legend of a bumbling panda beckoned to save the realms of China from an evil snow leopard, where the vital aspect of life itself is the power of belief. A basic moral for children to abide to, and a pleasing adventure for adults to be entertained by. Stunningly animated, particularly the introductory sequence resembling Chinese shadow puppetry, with many shots bursting vibrant colours at every opportunity. Even the lighting was superbly animated, bouncing off furry character models exquisitely. Zimmer's score harnessed Chinese instruments and utilised them to their full potential, exhuming a rural aesthetic that complemented the environmental design.<br/><br/>Then of course, you have Po. The titular beast that would do anything, and I mean anything, for a cookie or dumpling. Voiced excitedly by Black who executed his consistent comedic timing with ease, but failed to take hold of the more heartfelt moments. And that's where my biggest criticism lies.<br/><br/>The visual comedy overwhelmed the poignant moments for the characters which rarely allowed any connectivity between them. Oogway's departure, seen through the eyes of the fragile Shifu, was probably the only heartfelt moment. Po couldn't quite capture any pure emotion, whether that be due to the frenetic screenplay or Black's overabundance of comedy is up for debate. The remaining cast members, aside from Hoffman, were forgettable and could've been replaced by anyone. The Furious Five rarely made an impact to the overall story, and essentially only provided one fight scene against Tai Lung, whom of which was terribly miscast as McShane as he lacks that sharp bite from his voice. Atleast they addressed the fact that Mr. Ping (goose) was the adoptive father of Po (panda), because that could've been an awkward conversation for parents to have with their children.<br/><br/>With Kung Fu Panda being a DreamWorks Animation product, it's unequivocally one of their more memorable films. Beautifully encapsulating ancient China in an accessible story for everyone. Its simplicity and heartfelt absence does however prevent it from realising its true potential as an all-round animated classic. Wait, let me say it one more time...\"Skadoosh\".\n",
            "The Good Stuff (from best to least best)<br/><br/>1.) The two main characters are really well done. Po and Shifu's dynamic is fun throughout the whole film. You get to see Po start to believe in himself and Shifu warm up to him in some touching and comedic ways.<br/><br/>2.) The villain, Tai Lung, is really good. Its very hard to get a great hero and a great villain, but this movie did it. Tai Lung has a believable back story, a fun cocky attitude, and an excellent entrance.<br/><br/>3.) For a movie all about Kung Fu, it does not disappoint. The training and the fights are all well choreographed and fun to watch.<br/><br/>4.) I am quite the critic when it comes to comedy, usually being hard to win me over, but this movie definitely has its moments. Some of the jokes didn't land at all, but there were quite a few that got me.<br/><br/>The Bad Stuff (from worst to least worst)<br/><br/>1.) I really wish the Furious Five had more time to develop and feel like real characters. As it stands, besides Tigress, it's hard to even vaguely describe any of them.<br/><br/>2.) The story, while definitely not bad, feels a bit uninspired. They make the plot fun, but it still lacks when you realize the potential they had with the characters.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a great opener for the cast of characters. While it left some to be desired from the supporting characters, the main ones worked great together. Exciting fights, punchy comedic moments, and a lovable panda all work together to make a really fun movie.\n",
            "Like all other animations this movie sure took its time in developing the critical characters. Although maybe for this movie one might feel that it takes too much time in developing those characters that it feels that the character development still happens just until the main conflict, which is quite sudden for animation movie story flow. The jokes are absolutely funny, not necessarily because of the jokes itself, but because of Jack Black's comedic aura. I've watched two versions of this movie, one with original Enlish dialog with Jack Black's voice and one with dialog dubbed into Indonesian. The Indonesian version didn't have the jokes to be cracking laughs due to the dubber lacking Black's comedic prowess. The voice acting overall is nicely almost entirely Jack Black's influence. And that's quite fair in my view since his mark is all over the movie.\n",
            "I have to say, when I first heard about this movie, I thought it was going to be stupid; just another dumb animated movie with stupid jokes. And what do you know, I was right? This movie had a bunch of jokes that I can only see kids laughing at. I was 11 years old when I saw this and the humor still fell flat for me.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm giving it a 6/10 is because I liked the overall message at the end, which led me to watch the movie again. The jokes still sucked, but I learned to appreciate the characters more. I actually stopped disliking the main character at the end of this. Overall, an okay movie, nothing to go crazy over, but worth watching if you're bored.\n",
            "DreamWorks brings out yet another animated production but does it fill the shoes of the other films that they have recently made? Although this film is good the answer is sadly no. For starters an issue with this film is Jack Black. Granted he isn't that bad in this and it is his voice that is doing the work and not his acting, but his voice is so distinct that I couldn't help but imagine that it was actually him on the screen, especially when the part he is playing is an overweight, cartoon panda. Far to life like for me. Other voice members of this team remain hidden, Hoffman is brilliant as Master Shifu and his voice becomes lost in the character, also Ian McShane as Tai Lung the deadly snow leopard is deep and menacing. The same can't be said for all the other voice cast which includes such stars as Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, Lucy Lui and David Cross. All seem to get about ten lines each. Perhaps this isn't a problem with the voices but the character as they are so hard to connect with. Five animals, a tigress, crane, monkey, mantis and viper, all kicking ass but saying nothing, yep I can see why we can't connect with them. My favourite character I have to say was the Grand Master Oogway, an old tortoise that seemed to get everything right by accident and then state that nothing is an accident.<br/><br/>The film is about the Panda, Po. He dreams of being a kung fu warrior and not running his Dad's noodle bar, his Dad who is somehow a stork?? On the day that Oogway has a premonition that the feared Tai Lung will escape from jail, Shifu states that they must chose a Dragon Warrior to fend him off. The nominated Furious Five stake their claim but it is the panda that is selected when he accidentally flies into the arena, trying to catch a glimpse of what is going on. <br/><br/>Reluctantly Shifu begins to train him and we see that this panda is completely incompetent and the only thing he can do is eat. This however, as noticed by Shifu, is his strength. Relate aspects of kung fu to food and the panda will become awesome. <br/><br/>Tai Lung breaks out of jail, which is a very good sequence of CGI animation, and hurtles across the land to gather a Dragon Scroll out the hands of the Masters. The Dragon Scroll is what the Dragon Warrior possesses and it is an accomplishment that Tai Lung continually misses out on. Tai Lung's tale is told through a back story and his connection brings emotion to the film. Tai Lung eventually arrives at the palace and after defeating the Furious Five and Shifu it is down to the Panda to save the day.<br/><br/>As you can tell from the synopsis there are no real twists or turns and the film holds true to a very simple formula. This becomes a slight issue for me as it means children can connect with it more than adults, which certainly wasn't the case with Toy Story, Shrek, Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo and this is where this film lacks compared to those. There is nothing for an adult audience to really grip and enjoy. There is very little emotion in the film and the main humour is childish or slapstick. <br/><br/>The animation is still good. The Panda and Master Shifu having good genuine expressions but the Furious Five are undeveloped in character and animation. They could have all just been made into one character that has been worked on. Their story is just poor and very uninteresting.<br/><br/>That all being said it is a very easy watch film and I would happily sit down, chilling on a Sunday afternoon and watch it again. However using the term Jack Black must have written into the script as it is all he ever says in other films and over uses in this one, this film is certainly not awesome.\n",
            "Please do not critique my review based on the score which I have awarded this movie. This is a very fun-loving, action-packed yet very funny and lovable movie.<br/><br/>Po, as the overgrown lump for a panda, is very likable because of the voice casting of Jack Blak, who doesn't overdo it and make him sound ridiculous. But the character whom I liked the most was the old trainer of his who has the right voice as the kung fu master. The tortoise too is very witty and its funny to see such a slow creature being the greatest fighter.<br/><br/>The dialogs are meant for children as well as the adults who would enjoy the touch of adult humor that has been added here and there. Some of the situations are very funny, for example the thought of having a bird as the Panda's father, Po's efforts to watch the fair etc.<br/><br/>But the thin storyline affects the movie. Its a typical action flick that doesn't probably have much intentions of winning accolades and awards. Plus, it also lacks the charm that Disney movies offer.<br/><br/>I'm going to go with a 6 for this movie. Catch it once for sure.\n",
            "Po (Jack Black), a clumsy Panda, works at a noodle restaurant, but as an avid kung fu fan he dreams of being able to meet The Furious Five, a group of kung fu experts noted for their great ability and heroic deeds. One day, it is decided that one of The Furious Five will be granted the status of the Dragon Warrior, and a determined Po attempts to watch the tournament taking place. After various attempts to enter the Dojo, he finally gets in, only to be told that he is the future Dragon Warrior.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is quite a unique story: it is a clear parody of kung fu films but it does enough to prove that it pays homage to them as well. For instance, Po is told he will become the greatest warrior in the whole of China, but he is both overweight and clumsy, and has no martial arts training whatsoever: parody. However, the old and wise kung fu master, Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), has some very wise words, infused in traditional Chinese philosophy: homage. This becomes the most striking aspect of the film, and one which will no doubt be more attune t adults then children. Though it must be said that the film is more for kids then adults, unlike previous DreamWorks Animation productions such as Shrek, Madagascar and Flushed Away. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the film as a whole. The film is ridden with clichés, sometimes to aid the comedy, and the comedy itself can be far too silly at times. The film is also too short, and characterization pays for this. Beyond Po and Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), no other characters really gets any depth added to them. There is a little for Tigress (Angelina Jolie), but that is about it, and it's disappointing because it is possible that each character has a rich background. The length also lessens the overall impact of the film, with Po seemingly able to learn Kung Fu is a very short space of time. In fact, there were times where I felt totally disengaged with the film, wondering when it was going to show something that truly excited me.<br/><br/>But the action looks great, mostly due to the superb animation. Characters look like great representations of cartoons, and their body movements are fluid. There is also a great deal of detail, with much work being put into the fur of characters, and facial workings. Special effects do not appear to have gotten as much work on, but they are not bad at all, and work well with the other animation. DreamWorks Animation mus be commended for making a truly believable world and its clear to see references to other great martial arts films like House of Flying Daggers. If anything, its a shame that some good action sequences become used more to emphasis comedy then action, and makes the fighting less engaging then you would hope.<br/><br/>Music is very consistent, bringing traditional Chinese melodies expected of kung fu movies to the helm. At all times, it works, unlike the voice acting. Now all the voice actors do an impeccable job illustrating their respective characters, be it Angelina Jolie as the fiery Tigress, Ian MacShane as the evil Tai Lang, and even Randall Duk Kim as the serene and wise Oogway. And while Jack Black does a good enough job as Po, he comes across as too Jack Black, and Po as a character feels lifeless. In fact, the problem with Black is that unlike the other actors, he brings no charisma to his role. By no means is he a bad actor, his last role in Be Kind Rewind was great, but this time around, he doesn't quite gel with his character.<br/><br/>With unnoticeable tame language, and no sex or nudity, the film does have its fair share of violence. However it is far from being actually violent and is also used quite often for comical purposes.<br/><br/>As far as computer animations go, Kung Fu Panda is good, but not good enough to truly compete with the forerunners of the medium. For every aspect which makes Kung Fu Panda worth watching, humour and animation quality, there are aspects which make not worth the watch, simplistic story and lack of character development. It does what it sets out to do and that is entertain, but it falls short of what it should have tried to accomplish.\n",
            "Were sure it's not easy being an animated flick in a world where everybody can't wait for WALL-E but even with this looming Kung Fu Panda was not scared away. A valiant attempt to outdo Pixar is slightly smouldered by its misuse of its supporting cast (Angelina Jolie, Luci Lu and Jackie Chan) However with the failure that was Shrek the Third this is a film that puts DreamWorks credibility back on the line, will it ever be as good as Pixar? Probably not but Kung Fu Panda proves it can (at very least) look better than Pixar.<br/><br/>Visually, Kung Fu Panda is pretty unstoppable. High flying kicks and punches that can't be replicated in real life making this a must see for martial arts fans but the low brow humour and the fact that while the film manages to pull off some stunning visual treats but never really going anyway with the plotting makes this a fun but ultimately forgettable movie event. Brilliantly beautiful if a little flat. Black seems less irritating in GCI but the films wastes the rest of its unused cast.<br/><br/>A clumsy panda bear becomes an unlikely kung fu hero when a treacherous enemy spreads chaos throughout the countryside in this animated martial arts adventure featuring the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and Jackie Chan.<br/><br/>On the surface, Po (voice of Black) may look like just another portly panda bear, but beneath his fur he bears the mark of the chosen one. By day, Po works faithfully in his family's noodle shop, but by night he dreams of becoming a true master of the martial arts. Now an ancient prophecy has come to pass, and Po realizes that he is the only one who can save his people from certain destruction. with time running short and malevolent snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane ) closing in, Furious Five legends Tigress (Jolie), Crane (David Cross ), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Chan), and their wise sensei, Master Shifu (Hoffman), all draw on their vast knowledge of fighting skills in order to transform a lumbering panda bear into a lethal fighting machine. Now, if the noble Po can master the martial arts and somehow transform his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths, he will fulfill his destiny as the hero who saved his people during their darkest hour.<br/><br/>With its negatives looming, Kung Fu Panda still manages to do better than thoses DreamWorks disasters (Madagascar, Shark Tale) and while it didn't quite live up to the hype, and it won't do anything with the release of WALL-E. Kung Fu Panda is a great kids movie with several laughs that will even have the tightest ass hole laughing.<br/><br/>It's in the superb visuals and the fact that Kung Fu Panda really did try. It excels, but not enough to be noticed. It works however as a decent enough bridge to WALL-E, while its a crying shame that a film devoted to hard work simply cant stride far enough to be something truly spectacular. My final verdict? Give it ago, but don't go in expecting Shrek 2 or erm ... any other good DreamWorks animations? No? Oh well.\n",
            "A clumsy, overweight panda, Po, spends his time working as his father's noodle restaurant in the Valley of Peace. The Dragon Warrior, the champion fighter of the kingdom, is being chosen and Po, a kung fu fan, attends. To his surprise, he is chosen as the Dragon Warrior. This upsets the Furious Five, the protectors of the valley, who deem Po well beneath their standards as well as Shifu, the Furious Five's trainer. Po is at a low ebb when Tai Lung, the valley's biggest threat, escapes from prison. Now Po will have to fight Tai Lung to save the valley.<br/><br/>Good fun. Plot is okay, though hardly novel or unpredictable. Will mostly appeal to kids though some of the humour is great and will get a laugh out of adults.<br/><br/>Animation is excellent: even 13 years on in a world with 4K it is superb.<br/><br/>Voice casting is okay. No miscastings though similarly nobody really stands out either.<br/><br/>Not brilliant but entertaining enough. Kids will love it.\n",
            "As voiced by funnyman Jack Black, Po is just your average Chinese panda with dreams of one day becoming a world-class kung fu fighter (isn't that what all pandas living in China want to be?). When he's chosen by The Master to become the new Dragon Warrior, a position that brings virtually unlimited power to the individual who holds it, Po is thrown into round-the-clock training sessions to help groom him for the role - kind of like Eliza Doolittle on steroids.<br/><br/>The plot of \"Kung Fu Panda\" - with its echoes of \"The Karate Kid\" and even of \"Star Wars\" in its portrayal of teacher/pupil relationships - is fairly derivative in nature and lacks the kind of strong secondary characters we've come to expect from computer-animated films (no slam intended on the voice-over work by Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan).<br/><br/>Still, there is sufficient energy, wit and visual inventiveness in the movie to captivate the little ones while keeping the rest of us from actively storming the box office and demanding our money back. This is most definitely not one of the \"great ones,\" as animated features go, but it is short and pleasant enough to at least earn it a spot in the recommended column.\n",
            "Well, to start with an overview, this movie was definitely not a waste of time, and deserves the money. <br/><br/>The plot is kind of interesting, but a little too childish, and I'm sure it's meant to be. But the thing is that-- MANYYYYYYYY things are too exaggerated, too over the lines of any other exciting and exaggerated cartoon movie.<br/><br/>The plot also keeps you coming with a few..FEW.. gaps of comedy scenes. The story flows the way any other exaggerated action, and not comedy, movie flows. The scenes that make you laugh, really, i say really, make you laugh. <br/><br/>But when i was seated in the movie room with all the other people, i saw that all the families were laughing together, so the movie was absolutely worthwhile and well done.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 1 star for all the hard jobs that were done for completing the movie. 2 stars for the laughs. Another 2 stars for the suspense and the creative plot. And 1 star for the well-thought characters that seemed very hard to create. 6/10. -4 for the too much exaggeration. But go ahead and watch the movie with your family, it's worth it.\n",
            "I was definitely excited to see Kung Fu Panda. I \"prepared for awesomeness\" as its fun trailer suggested, but it wasn't as engaging as I thought it would be. It opens with a stylized fight sequence that belongs more in highbrow children's books that thankfully ended after my first yawn.<br/><br/>Po (voice by Jack Black) is an impressionable, fat panda who regularly daydreams about kung fu fighting as he helps his pop run their noodle shop. He finally gets to realize his dream when he is chosen to be trained by the great kung fu master Shifu (voice by Dustin Hoffman) to fight against the evil Tai Lung (voice by Ian McShane), much to the chagrin of Shifu's highly trained posse of Tigress (voice by Angelina Jolie), Monkey (voice by Jackie Chan), Mantis (voice by Seth Rogen), Viper (voice by Lucy Liu) and Crane (voice by David Cross).<br/><br/>It had truly awesome fight scenes (especially noteworthy Tai Lung's escape from prison) and its share of kung fu wisdom, but overall, the writing and illustration just wasn't as clever or as funny as it promised. The animals were plain and androgynous so their personalities were very reliant on their characters' voices, especially the Tigress (thanks to Jolie's unmistakably sultry voice). Only the panda had a wider variety of facial expressions, and only very few of his lines were able to elicit some chuckles from the adults in the audience. The children were more easily enamored.\n",
            "This movie was entertaining first off. Which I think all movies should be. Now let it be known Dreamworks is no Pixar in terms of story development. Yet visually it was on par with Wall-E. The characters designs were very nice and stylized.<br/><br/>Yet here's the clincher the story was nothing short of typical. There was nothing that possibly set it apart from other movies like itself. There has even been books and televisison shows and movies and even videogames that preceed this that are based on some the principles of this movie.<br/><br/>The main character Po was just that po' in character development. It was just another Jack Black character except this time with fur. The casting was nothing spectacular. Could Dreamworks have maybe did a little bit more with it's actual casting. Yes. Instead they choose top celebs or celebs that basically everyone is accustomed to and gave them roles. The other characters besides Po had little to no personality to me except for maybe Master Sif.<br/><br/>The humor was typical Dreamworks so I won't touch that but otherwise I can tell you now that if you're looking for a nice way to kill some time this way movie is the way to do it.<br/><br/>My overall score is a 6\n",
            "good animated movie for the kids but if you're not a fan of animated movies, of course this movie is not for you. this movie alone is not worth the money. voices are great, although i'm a bit tired of hearing Jack Black's voice. it gets quite irritating.<br/><br/>Basically we've got a plot for an animated movie, that is overly didactic. The main character, a panda, learns his true dreams and pursues this dream, eventually reaching the zenith of his career. He achieves the seemingly impossible, with the indirect aid of his goose father and a kung fu master. Does this plot seem familiar? Mm hmm.<br/><br/>This movie isn't special. It's purely entertainment. But it is more animated than most other movies, and a lot more vivid/character-involved. Sooo you'll guess correctly that it's kind of boring for the older audience. Kung fu Panda is fun but the humor is seriously directed to the younger audience (&lt;14.) If you think it can serve as a source of inspiration for the young kids, in that anything is possible, then go for it.\n",
            "7\n",
            "In China, the big, fat and clumsy Panda Po is a great fan of martial arts and worships The Furious Five - Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey – and their Master Shifu. He works in the restaurant of his father specialized in noodles, but he dreams on being a kung fu hero. When Master Oogway summons the population to announce who would be The Dragon Warrior, he surprisingly points out to the slacker Po, frustrating the expectations of Master Shifu and Tigress. Po joins the academy of Master Shifu that does not believe that Po might be The Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile the evil Tai Lung breaks out the high-security prison where he has been arrested for twenty years and heads to the temple of Oogway, expecting to get the Dragon Scroll and becomes more powerful. The Furious Five tries to intercept Tai Lung, but they are defeated. Now the only chance to stop Tai Lung is the glutton Po.<br/><br/>\"Kung Fu Panda\" is a very funny and entertaining animation, with the delightful story of a clumsy Panda that dreams on being a hero. The computer-animated heroes and villain are hilarious, supported by the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angeline Jolie and other magnificent actors and actresses. Po is tailored for Jack Black and I can not imagine this character without his voice. Dustin Hoffman also makes the difference with the voice of the wise Master Shifu. I just regret that I did not pay much attention to this animation before and only now I have watched it. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): \"Kung Fu Panda\"\n",
            "I am not a big fan of Dreamworks' non-Aardman movies after Shrek. They used too many jokes, pop-culture references etc. instead of serving real story with real characters. The only exception is, I think, Over the Hedge, which, while not really Pixar-standard, is one where they didn't overuse pop-culture references but gave us lovable characters and a good story. I think Kung Fu Panda is closer to Over the Hedge than other Dreamworks-movies. Actually I didn't find real pop-culture references (while there may be a lot of references to martial arts movies - I lack knowledge of them - there is nothing that does not fit to the story and the characters) at all. Slapstick is very childish in the movie; I can understand that, they wanted to sell it to the little ones too. But other than that, and most of the time, it is a beautifully-animated kung-fu movie with great scenery that is more for adults and kung-fu movie lovers than for children. They even give time for character building, although it is only for the Panda and the two masters; others are really one-dimensional (they even don't really have too much screen time for more). The story is nothing new, but maybe that's not something you would expect from a Kung-fu movie. All in all, the movie is much more fun and sensitive but with less jokes than its ads suggest. i did like it even if I didn't love it - maybe you should be a kung-fu fan for the latter.\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is Po (Jack Black), a bear who does not have the right girth for the martial arts. He works in his father's noodle restaurant but dreams of joining the Furious Five, China's famous kung fu fighters which also represent a style of martial arts. Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Viper and Crane.<br/><br/>A prophecy reveals that Po is to be the new Dragon Master to the surprise of Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). However Po does not take to the tough training regime well which is designed to make him fail, the Furious Five mock him and Shifu realises that food motivates Po.<br/><br/>When a vengeful Tai Lung (Ian McShane) escapes prison and goes after Shifu, it is left to the Kung Fu Panda to save the day.<br/><br/>The film is enjoyable family fun, the overweight panda provides comedy as he struggles to learn kung fu, there are plenty of wise Chinese proverbs, colourful animation, frenetic action scenes and a reworked version of Everybody is Kung Fu fighting.\n",
            "Pixar is where it is at for me animation-wise in Hollywood. Maybe that makes me a snob, but something about their films resonant on a level that the others can't even begin to touch. Sure Shrek and Madagascar are funny, but besides the off-belly laugh, they are kind of shallow and hollow. With that said, I went to check out Dreamworks new foray into computer graphic cinema, Kung Fu Panda. Admittedly, I knew very little about this thing other than the fact that Jack Black and Angelina Jolie voiced characters. It could possibly be due to the fact that I don't watch much TV, but I've seen sparse promotion at best until walking into the theatre and seeing a giant 3D panda in the lobby. On the whole, the film plays out much like you'd want a family/kid friendly picture to. We are given examples of friendship, belief in oneself, and humilityall life lessons we hope to inspire our youth with. With a good backbone such as that, along with some humorous bits and stunning action choreography, this panda definitely packs a punch doing his job: entertaining the audience right until the final frame.<br/><br/>Credit the producers for compiling a top-notch roster of vocal talent to enhance the somewhat ho-hum script. These types of movies are never very original, so it takes a bit of extra panache to really draw me in. Black is actually quite good in the role and Po the panda plays right into his schtick. When arriving at the hall of warriors, he goes to every artifact and does his thing, screaming his excitement at all the cool stuff like it's his JB character from Tenacious D eying Jimi Hendrix's first guitar. The Kung Fu arm mannerisms even recall his air guitar/rock n' roll motions. Black is somewhat restrained and his manic energy is reigned in to be effective on the comedic and dramatic levels. This guy is, after all, our entrance into the story and the character we are supposed to relate to. An outcast and an original, we all can see a bit of ourselves, always dreaming but never taking the leap to achieve those goals. We watch his evolution and start to believe that it could happen to us too.<br/><br/>It is a fine line for the supporting roles. A Panda with historical knowledge of the ancient art yet without any actual experience has been proclaimed the savior of the valley against a monster of a foe. He is truly the ugly duckling and all those around him must straddle the division of chiding him and the absurdity of the situation, but not be too meanthere are kids watching. In order to keep a good grasp on this tenuous situation, the filmmakers cast a group of affable people with the ability to work in serious moments, but never relinquish the humorous edge to their voice. Guys like David Cross, Seth Rogen, and Jackie Chan are perfect for the roles of the true warriors attempting to reconcile their preconceptions of this screw-up swooping in and taking their thunder. Moments like the acupuncture scene really show this to be true. Jolie is good as Tigress, another fighter and prize student, but the role ends up being pretty forgettable and by the books. She never really gets the range to go crazy. Neither does Dustin Hoffman as the master and teacher to them all, yet he is a still a success. My favorite supporter was the great Ian McShane as Tai Lung, the villain of the tale. No one has a better voice for nefarious deeds than this guy and he delivers continuously.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it is a nice tale to teach the kids about faith and comradery. For us older folk, however, we are treated with some spectacular action/battle sequences to satisfy our want for more than just preaching. The chopstick fight between Hoffman and Black is fantastic, having comedy and tenacity with some nice artwork and fast paced movement. The battle on a rope bridge towards the end, as well as the final confrontation, is also highly enjoyable. Credit the entertainment to the acting and a gimmick that at first made me cringe. Throughout the film we are treated with slow-motion insertions during the action. A nod to old Kung Fu films and the satirical spoofs created as a result, I was thinking I'd grow tired of the maneuver very fast. Fortunately, as the movie continues on, the moments become sprinkled in with perfect timing. The escape from Rhino prison wouldn't have been half as fun without the speed changes in the action and the slow-mo facial expressions of those getting thrown around. Even towards the end, the filmmakers began to use it as an original comedic device. Capturing Po's reaction to a charging Tai Lung is absolutely priceless.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is by no means a masterpiece, but for a cartoon that really flew under my radar, I had a lot of fun taking part in the experience. Right from the beginning, with a stylized 2D rendered sequence as an introduction, I saw that this wouldn't be quite the run-of-the-mill work I was anticipating. Always staying fresh and funny I can fully endorse anyone wanting to check it out as a nice appetizer to what could be a fantastic main course in Pixar's Wall-E come this summer.\n",
            "Dreamworks Animation has it very tough now a days, living forever in the shadow of Pixar. But it's been hard to feel sorry for them. In the seven years after the smash success of the movie \"Shrek\", they've only managed to churn out one mediocre and simplistic animated film after the other, set apart only by their top celebrity voices, and laden with kids only humor and tired pop-culture jokes. They haven't been bad per say, but when the competition is the likes of Toy Story or Finding Nemo, you start to wish they'd try a little harder. Now along comes Kung Fu Panda, easily the best CGI kids film the studio has come up with. It's nothing spectacular, but it's great fun, and probably the most fun a family can have together at the movies this summer...in a movie without trash cleaning robots.<br/><br/>The trailers for this film did nothing for me, but the minute its exciting and hilarious 2D opening was done, I knew I was for in something good. The story is definitely not the movie's strong point. It tells the basic tale of Po, voiced by Jack Black, a young and very overweight Great Panda and son of a noodle salesman, who dreams of one day being a Kung Fu master and joining the ranks of his idols, The Furious Five (characters representing the five classic styles of Shaolin Kung-fu: a tiger, crane, monkey, mantis, and snake, voiced by Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen and Lucy Liu respectively). When a premonition warns of the escape of the evil kung fu master Tai-Lung (Ian McShane), former student of the stern sensei Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), it is decided that the sacred title of \"Dragon Warrior\" must be given to a brave soul in hopes of stopping him. <br/><br/>That title unsurprisingly lands on Po. As you might expect, there is a lot of doubting, and worry, until Po learns about the \"hero within\" and...well you've seen it all before. It's very bare bones, but it's acceptable enough when the movie's strengths work so well.<br/><br/>The voices and animation are top notch thankfully. All the actors fit well with their characters (Black can do the hefty underdog routine in his sleep) and do a fine job without a hint of them phoning it in, with Hoffman and McShane as the real standout. Hoffman excels as the up tight wise man or teacher that all Kung Fu movies need, though the Furious Five have a disappointingly smaller role then it seems they should, but have some great moments as well. <br/><br/>The animation is crisp and beautiful; this film's fantasized world of ancient China really shines, and must be seen on the big screen. The animation lends itself well to the film's main attraction-the fights. You may think a PG rated kid's film might skimp on quality fights, \"Kung Fu\" in the title or not, but in this case you'd be very mistaken. The fights are fast paced, thrilling, and delightfully executed (even borrowing some choreography from various well known kung fu flicks in some occasions) and for a PG movie, somewhat brutal. Nothing too serious mind you, but if you're a prude when it comes to kids and violence, beware. Neither the heroes nor the villain in this movie mess around when it comes to the fights. <br/><br/>The movie also seems to be a bit lacking in the humor department, which takes back seat to the action. It's still funny (without having to resort to Pop-culture gags even), but it really isn't the laugh a minute comedy you or your kids might be expecting.<br/><br/>The film's other strong point is its villain. Even in best children movies, a villain's motivation usually never stretches beyond \"because he's evil\", so imagine my surprise when Kung-Fu Panda not only provides its bad guy with some well done back story and motivation, but even manages to make him a little sympathetic. There's a scene between him and Shifu near the end that contains some strong themes that'll fly over most children's heads, and is a treat to watch. As mentioned, McShane's voice is a major standout, bringing Tai Lung to life with a sneering and devilish quality. <br/><br/>The movie chickens out at the end unfortunately, in order to stay kid friendly, shying it away from greatness. While it still fails just short of the quality and heart of the Pixar films (well, it's better than Cars anyway), KFP still provides a lot of fun and thrills for kids and grown ups a like. It's a fun, simple little summer film that any family should look into, especially if you happen to be raising little kung-fu fans of your own.\n",
            "While Pixar follows a line of more complex and intelligent animations, full of meaning and visually bold, the other producers continue to bet on the basics: Action and a lot of humor. Now and then, however, productions from this second echelon come out as good as those of the studio linked to Disney. PDI / DreamWorks Animation had already hit the nail on the head with Shrek and now creates a new character with so much potential to become a new millionaire franchise: the panda Po.<br/><br/>Surprising even in its first moments, when it begins the narrative with a beautiful sequence of animation in 2D, Kung Fu Panda is, technically, a production that lives up to the growing experience of PDI / DreamWorks - and the visuals of the characters maintain a great balance between the real and the cartoonish, staying between the likelihood of Selvagem and the caricature of Madagascar. On the other hand, the animators do not shy away from using exaggeration in the expressions of the creatures in search of humor and, thus, Po and his companions twist their jaws in an absurd way, exhibit an intense tremor in their eyes when frightened and move without caring. The laws of physics. Still, the animation team finds room for sophistication by turning Oogway into a senile individual and likely victimized by Parkinson's disease, as his constant (but not exaggerated) tremors are brilliantly conceived by IDP artists. Likewise, it is interesting to see how the spots on the hair of the villain Tai Lung are used to create the impression of a muscular abdomen, which highlights his frightening air.<br/><br/>A more critical look identifies easily: Kung Fu Panda is a film of a single joke - that of the fat panda wanting to fight and causing the greatest disasters with its clumsy attitudes. However, the short duration - it is a mere 90 minutes - and the agility of editing and photography, which present some of the most elaborate and well-structured shots of modern animation, guarantee the spectator's interest throughout the course of the action. And this is present from the beginning to the end. The strokes are very funny and well developed - the panda training, always behind a new plate of food, is just hilarious - and everything is present within a completely understandable logic. The design is light and precise, beautiful to see and full of details that make the most demanding people happy.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda goes beyond the breaking of stereotypes, in a possible didactic regarding the prejudice against fat people, or an imposition of the Western social theme in an Eastern mythology. In fact, the great principle of the panda, inferior to its physical size, rationally speaking, is shown in the unnamed resistance of the animal panda as an image of Chinese art. If the Furious Five that Po idolized were qualitative figures in martial art, the whole process of the film is to prove that the panda (like tiger, snake, heron, grasshopper and monkey), is also a symbol animal, an attribute to learn Kung Fu. For this reason, the exercise of the film in \"surprising\" the stereotypically fat animal to fight is because one hardly ever looks at the biological or psychological particularities of this stereotype, especially for an agile Kung Fu fight. It is not by chance that the voice actor who plays the protagonist Po is from actor Jack Black, who always used, in general, his physical form for comedy, but without depending on her to make varied films. Then, prejudice is revealed, by the judgment of the serious training in being impossible for a panda. Thus, through comedy, there is a plausible field of possibilities in the film, even slow motion to better capture the fast, elaborate and impactful Kung Fu action scenes.<br/><br/>With very few narrative pretensions other than 90 minutes of humorous adventure, the film stands out especially for its art direction. The technique of computer graphics is beautiful, attentive to the smallest plastic details and extremely colorful, stylized but with something oriental - obviously taking advantage of the setting in China. Raymond Zibach's good production design (Sinbad: The Legend of the Seven Seas) results in interesting settings, like the village and the monastery, but - again - nothing that is particularly inspired or breathtaking (with the exception of prison) guarding Tai Lung, who is impressive for his vertical geography. The action sequences are correct most of the time, although they only show brilliance in two moments: during the battle on the suspension bridge and in a great dispute between Po and Shifu. In fact, once again, the animators keep referring to other features similar to a few and subtle elements, such as running through the roofs of the village at night (The Tiger and the Dragon) and, of course, the fantasy tone and themes recurrents of the genus wuxia pian.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the 2D sequence that opens the film is ambitious in its stylization, the rest of the narrative, performed in 3D, exhibits a visual logic without imagination or personality, limiting itself to framing the characters in a bureaucratic and not very expressive way - and the maximum that directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson can conceive of \"differently\" boils down to a few freeze frames that try to extract humor from Tai Lung's blows while he attacks his jailers. On the other hand, cinematographer Yong Duk Jhun at least tries to make the experience more interesting (albeit unoriginal) by bathing the flashbacks in a nostalgic gold that contrasts with the gray and cold tones that mark the scenes starring the villain.<br/><br/>The digital animation of Kung Fu Panda was filmed in CinemaScope, a film format used from 1953 to 1967, that is, also in classic martial arts films. In addition, the animals that make up the Furious Five represent styles of fighting that really exist in kung fu, which has styles inspired by animal movements. Such precision in portraying this universe includes research that began five years ago, involving all Chinese aesthetics. The producers also took kung fu classes and film marathons of the genre to understand the movements that should be imprinted on the characters in the animation. The result is an animation produced with excellence. In addition to having charismatic characters - especially the protagonist -, Kung Fu Panda sounds like a tribute to the height of kung fu features. The movements of the characters, the direction and the way the cameras move between the grandiose scenarios created for the feature film always refer to the genre's productions.<br/><br/>But if the script is unpretentious, apart from one harmless scene of \"Buddhism for Westerners to see\", that does not mean that it has moments of pure brilliance. The scene with Po outside the temple where the tournament is being held to define the Dragon Warrior is excellent for not showing anything that is happening inside. The suggestion, through sound, a narrator and any pyrotechnics that escape the building, is hopeless. Just like Panda, who cannot see his idols inside, we are distressed. Another great detail is the bear's hilarious relationship with his father (a goose!), Which the film leaves without any explanation, in a delightful nonsense moment. If the two are so happy that way, why would you want to know their origins? The captivating irrelevance of this moment is another asset of the text, which also includes other fun details, such as the fact that all citizens are \"Chinese food\" (pigs, ducks, rabbits ...).<br/><br/>Benefited by having friendly characters (it is impossible not to admire the excitement of Po, who is happy even when he is beaten by his idols), Kung Fu Panda still offers a strong dramatic element through the internal conflicts of the master Shifu - and it is touching to see him try to face Tia Lung only to be weakened by the very memories he has of the villain while he was still a sweet cub. Less interesting, on the other hand, is the development of old and beaten themes from DreamWorks animations (and I also include 2D productions), such as the need to \"fight for dreams\", the maxim of \"be yourself\"\" And so on. In general, it is a good example to have fun with the children and to have some sincere good laughs.\n",
            "Innovation. Yes, DreamWorks has outdone itself. An incredible story, with the fantastic script, performances of the characters are unreal. It is an animation with incredible graphics, as in the scene where Tai Lung escapes from prison. The fight scenes are applauding, leaving the film exciting, as well as several humorous ingredients.<br/><br/>Film seen on October 12, 2020.\n",
            "One of the best DreamWorks movies to watch and laugh.\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, a fat clumsy Panda, son of a noodle shop owner goose, who loves Kung Fu and dreams of being a Kung Fu hero and finds himself being chosen as The Chosen One to fight the evil forces and a renegade who threatens his village.<br/><br/>The animation, an action comedy, is good and very lovable, but nothing remarkable. The story is predictable, the message \"believe in yourself no matter what\" well known, and the characters stereotypical. However, the script is great, very engaging and funny, the main characters and the performances of most voice actors are so good that you soon forget the flaws of the film and fully immerse yourself in it.<br/><br/>The film is highly indebted to Jack Black's performance and self-deprecating humor, which really suits the personality of Po. At the end of the movie one wonders, what came first, the Panda or Jack? Also brilliant in their dubbing are Dustin Hoffman as the cranky teacher Shifu, Randall Duk Kim as the wise spiritual old tortoise Oogway, James Hong as Po's goose father Mr. Ping, and Dan Fogler as Zeng.<br/><br/>The other characters, despite being important, are mostly action figures and don't have many dialogs, but the voice actors d0 a good job too: Ian McShane as the renegade snow leopard Tai Lung, Jackie Chan as Monkey, Seth Rogen as the Mantis, Lucy Liu as the Viper, David Cross as Crane. Angelina Jolie's voicing of Sexy Tigress is very bad; she sounds as if she was reading something without acting; she should have made the effort, as her character has only a few lines, or the directors demand more from her.<br/><br/>This is one of those unpretentious movies that, even if you don't fancy to watch, will certainly entertain and amuse you. Great time and fun for everybody!\n",
            "The animated story of a fat panda dreaming to become a great ninja should have been about awkwardness, involuntary humour and overcoming one's limitations. This film was exactly that. The voice acting was top notch, the 3D animation good, the funny animal faces perfect. But it was so incredibly predictable, that it brought only a type of indifferent fun for me. Maybe it was because I have seen old Jackie Chan movies and I knew how things will go, PG rated and everything, but every single little scene was in my head before it happened.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it is one of those funny American animations that you can easily laugh to, but that slip your mind the next day. You've got fat jokes, kung-fu jokes, funny faces, an angry misguided villain and the calm wise master; you've got animals acting like humans because it is funnier, not because it means anything to the story; you've got an easy effortless win from a natural talent. The secret ingredient was truly nothing.\n",
            "Like the rest of the western world, I love Pixar - from Toy Story to The Incredibles to Ratatouille, they've delivered some of the finest, most timeless and age-proof entertainment of the last fifteen years. Even their lesser efforts like A Bug's Life and Cars make the other kids' movies that surround them at the multiplex look leaden and trite. But this casts the harsh, judgmental light of comparison on Dreamworks, and although Shrek was a fun little flick (that has rapidly aged), I haven't been impressed by most of the work they've put out since then, pop culture-infused cookie-cutter kiddie flicks awkwardly constructed around their voice stars (the fish with Will Smith's face will forever haunt my dreams).<br/><br/>But everyone can change and everyone can evolve, and while Kung Fu Panda isn't a pockmark on a timeless piece of art like Pixar's Ratatouille, it's a lovingly constructed, humorous, and more-than-competently made tribute to old kung fu movies and a solid piece of entertainment. I genuinely liked it.<br/><br/>First off, unlike the ilk of Shrek, this movie contains NO pop culture references other than innate stylistic similarities to the kung fu flicks it lightly satirizes and pays tribute to. It stands on its own feet. Secondly, while the titular panda is very much an avatar for Jack Black's standard goofy personality, the movie doesn't make the easy mistake of just taking that and letting it sit there like a limp fish (voiced by Will Smith) - while it mines that particular style for humor all the way through, the character is forced to take responsibility and evolve, and the evolution is pretty much the same standard you would ask for if this movie were the same story starring Jack Black done in live action. Citizen Kane it's not, but there is a character arc. Third, the animation leaves Madagascar and Ice Age choking to death in its dust. No, it's not Wall·E, but the characters are fluid and vibrant and the art and settings have a vaguely dusty, ancient, ethereal, Chinese feel to them that doesn't feel phoned in.<br/><br/>Also, the infinite potential of animation is actually taken advantage of to produce some pretty nifty kung fu / fight scenes. It's obviously all synthetic, being animated and whatnot, but the choreography and ideas actually build on that to do neat things that couldn't be done in live action (at least not easily and without millions of wires). There are old-fashioned kung fu fights with kicks and blocks and punches and jumps, that have a sense of momentum and energy. None of the action blew my mind to pieces but it was all entertaining to watch. As was the comedy, which was pretty much all either slapsticky type mishaps or building on the \"Jack Black\" personality, but relatively little of it felt juvenile, and I had some laughs.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not perfect by any stretch. The story - fittingly for a kung fu movie - is very simple, straightforward, and doesn't innovate in any way. None of the characters besides Po the panda, his primary mentor Shifu (skillfully voice acted by Dustin Hoffman), and the villain receive any development whatsoever; they are pretty much all paper-flat, and it seems a shame that they have Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, Angelina Jolie, and Jackie Chan voice acting but barely use them for more than a half-dozen lines each. But I don't think the kids this movie was basically made for will care, and not having ten million pop culture references, this movie actually won't painfully age year by year like certain movies starring green ogres played by Mike Myers. So I'd give Kung Fu Panda a thumbs up, not an ecstatic one, but a comfortable one.\n",
            "I don't know what to say, exactly, about this movie, except that it was about as close to pure distilled comedic awesome as I have come into contact with in recent years. That said, this is not humor for every person, as it is not always perfectly clear where the punchline is. The fact of the matter is that the entire movie should be treated as one giant jab at old, super-cheesy Kung-Fu movies. However, rather than flatly lampooning it, what we wind up with is a deconstructionist approach to the genre. Rather than making fun of specific elements, Kung Fu Panda seems to set out to, instead, write every Kung Fu movie ever made, and does so to hilarious effect. It is a simple plot, but well-executed, and the animation is superb. Every frame is a work of art.<br/><br/>The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie a perfect score is that it is so simple, and the depth of the movie suffers somewhat from it. However, the movie does have a point, let no one convince you otherwise. It is nothing earth-shattering, and is somewhat in the vein of \"feel-good\" types of thematic statements, but it is, all in all, an excellent movie, and one I would recommend all should see. Unless you have a personal vendetta against Dreamworks, CGI movies, animation, Eastern culture, martial arts, or Jack Black, I could just about guarantee you would enjoy this movie.\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda opens up more loose ends than it has time to tie shut, but for a kids' movie, it's well-constructed, showcases some of the most absorbing action sequences and gorgeous cinematography animation has seen, and has a real heart at its squishy panda centre.\n",
            "We follow Po (Jack Black), a lazy and overweight noodle chef, on his quest to becoming a legendary warrior and keeper of the coveted Dragon Scroll - a scroll which holds the key to unprecedented powers.<br/><br/>Po is fan boy of the Kung Fu warriors in his valley - the Furious Five - and their guru Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), and has always wanted to be as great as they are. Po has lots of tenacity (especially if or when food is involved), but little energy or skills.<br/><br/>Po is thrust into the position of rising to the challenge of defending the valley against the evil Tai Lung (Ian McShane) who has escaped from prison and is seeking the Dragon Scroll for himself - a prize he was promised.<br/><br/>The key lesson in this film is that there is no easy, instantly achieved greatness or success - the things you want the most require time and dedication. The film is wrapped up in the theme of never give up, and work together, as most animations are.<br/><br/>Positives are the good animation and visuals, the large casting, and the action sequences are fantastical and dynamic. The visuals are clean and the landscapes pretty - vibrant colour palette.<br/><br/>The negatives for me are the lack of Chinese inspired score, some of the voice actors were overlooked or lacklustre, and the pretty unrealistic storyline of someone with no talent besting talented individuals with little practice just because he \"believes\" it.<br/><br/>Could have been more funny in terms of dialogue or cultural references, but instead it relies on slapstick comedy and environmental humour (his weight bending or breaking things).<br/><br/>Not terrible overall, but not bad.\n",
            "The movie is about a panda and his friends training for a epic battle against a evil tiger.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie because it was very entertaining and the battle was epic\n",
            "I recomend this movie for ages 3 to 12.\n",
            "Kung Fu panda is fun for almost any age to watch. Even after rewatching this movie I feel it holds up today, though not everything is as funny as it was when I was kid. Something this movie does well is having a sort of symbolism that kids and adults can understand and at different levels. This symbolism or moral is something that isn't just people over analyzing the movie but something that is present throughout the entire movie. The voice acting in the movie elevates the humor to the max and Jack Black was casted perfectly for the main character.\n",
            "Despite its limitations, \"Kung-Fu Panda\" is bound to have some redeeming qualities. Po is a memorable hero in an interesting, humorous, and outlandish way. Tai-Lung, played by Ian McShane, is one of the best cartoon villains since Shere Khan. Despite its limitations, \"Kung-Fu Panda\" is bound to have some redeeming qualities. There is no quirky cliche that is too boring for filmmakers to exploit. The narrative is rice paper thin, and the characters, while charming, are simply overpopulated.\n",
            "I had the opportunity to rewatch the first film from the Kung Fu Panda franchise recently. Watching this movie as a child and as a grown up can be a totally different experience each time. This movie lives up to the definition of a classic comedy/family genre film. This Oscar nominee film from DreamWorks animations is quiet famous for its pleasing mix of comedy, martial arts and its influence from eastern philosophies. Jack Black has done an exceptional job as giving voice to the protagonist (Po). This was a nice movie with likeable characters, although story and events seem quite simple and predictable for an older audience's point of view, its elegantly drawn scenes and animations makes it a visual treat for anyone who loves eastern culture, the action-packed scenes which are full of energy make this appealable even for older audience and on the other hand for the younger audience watching this would seem like acquiring a treasure. \"Kung Fu Panda\" is a story that almost tells itself in in its title. Its hard to imagine a fat and fuzzy panda doing martial arts, the story of the film is exactly that it takes us through the journey how this panda who had all odds stacked against him achieve his dreams through pure determination and a mentality to never quit. After watching this movie multiple times, I have found that this movie had a perfect mix of comedy, martial arts and eastern philosophies as its inspiration. The comedy throughout the film does not stand out as extremely funny but at the same time there is a balanced interval between each comedy scenes which makes the whole film get a balanced humor throughout the plot making it appealable to watch without getting bored. The action sequences have also depicted a unique style in fighting when It comes to the fighting style of (Po) which makes it interesting and more acceptable to comprehend the animation work and art style that emphasizes the protagonist which makes the martial art in the film unique in its own way. The whole moviehas eastern culture written all over it, not only from the visual point of view but also throughout the plot one can experience the various shades of eastern philosophies that sets it apart from other comedy/family genre movies. Kung Fu Panda teaches us valuable life lessons about everything from martial arts to life itself. This can be best seen throughout the movie such as when (Grand Master Oogway) advices (Po) with his famous quote \"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift. That is why it is called present.\" Here the movie teaches us a valuable lesson inspired from the eastern culture of Buddhism which is we should accept the past and not fear the future and live in the present. There and many other examples such as how the character (Grand Master Oogway) acts as a source of knowledge and inspiration from multiple quotes which signifies the importance of fate and the eastern philosophies such as everything happens for a reason and there are no accidents. The movie also encourages us to dream and pursue new heights as how the protagonist overcomes his difficulties and moves forward. There is quiet a lot of hidden meanings spread across the plot of the movie that may seem different for each and every one. There are multiple scenes and events in this film that amused me such as how the word \"Shifu\" translates to master in Chinese and how the furious.five are inspired by five different forms of kung fu. Kung Fu Panda also foreshadows both of the upcoming sequels in its opening scenes. Another thing that usually older audiences might notice is that the films cast is stacked with prominent and well know actors from the main roles to the supporting roles. The end credits scenes resemble the art shadow puppetry of ancient China. Overall, throughout the movie one can experience a vast variety of eastern cultural visual treat. At a glance when you see from outside the movie seems to look like a simple and predictable and an average film but when you dig deeper you would see how much work has gone into each character and every aspect and style the animations and drawings are done. Almost every major scene in the movie has an influence from eastern philosophies that have multiple meanings and perspectives to understand the plot. This makes sure that everyone who watches this movie will have a unique pick for them. I would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie at least once in a lifetime as this a not only proven to be entertaining but also seems to be much more informative and educational when it comes to life. The deeper messages within the story tells us a lot about the real world. Parents can rest easy knowing that this movie contains numerous life lessons. So, watch this movie with an open mind I am sure you will find something or the other that will intrigue you.\n",
            "While there was the occasional immaturity that accompanies any Jack Black film, the majority of Kung Fu Panda was very enjoyable. The voice acting was great, the action sequences were fun and the animation was gorgeous. Two scenes of the film, Oogway's farewell and Po's real training with Master Shifu, made this film jump from the \"good\" category to the \"pretty good\". I watched this on the big screen on a Daddy/Son date with Noah at the Spanish Fork Cinemark. The experience of watching a film in theaters again was fantastic!\n",
            "Not a big Animated watcher but still this Franchise has caught me up to follow but here I am only talking about the first installment of the movie which roams around the making of Dragon Warriors who is unorthodox and even did not met up with the criteria for being one but fate had its own planning the film is good for all the right reasons however the message is familiar but blended nicely with Humor, strong dialogues and some Kung Fu actions, this animated movie is both likable and watchable at the same time for all ages and genders\n",
            "Nice animation project from DreamWorks after a while. Entertaining.<br/><br/>Emotional.<br/><br/>Inspiring.\n",
            "I do not know that it is still possible. Thanks to first impressions advertisements and personal experience. I thought I would get a stupid silly children's movie that hopefully can entertain your 3 year old.<br/><br/>BUT I was 100% wrong. The movie was incredible in the truest sense of the word.\n",
            "It was a really serious, and profound martial-arts-film you can also interpreting with a good message.<br/><br/>Po is, of course, a typical \"All-Loving Hero,\" but in this movie, it was indeed a good fit to understand his goals and motivation, so you are always excited when he went one step further and was happy with his success and progress the time is learning more and more.\n",
            "In addition, I find Tai Lung is not a good opponent let alone antagonist. He has a good fighting style but does not do much and is not really taken seriously of his cheap motivation.\n",
            "That would be tolerable if he was at least really dangerous or visibly evil, but he's just a strong jerk.\n",
            "Tai Lung does not even have a really balanced character design, a few red or black shades would have done him good.<br/><br/>That made the whole movie a wonderful experience and tied me to the screen from the first second.\n",
            "The colors, the world and the music immediately fascinated me and all with such an interesting lore that I first thought it was a bit wasted on a children's movie.\n",
            "But there I was also completely wrong, because the idea and implementation are so perfectly interlocked that it's great to grow up with such a movie.<br/><br/>All that and a few super cool fights that you could compare to a Jackie Chan movie.\n",
            "The only things you could probably improve on are Po's clumsiness. Because the fat comic relief is not permanently funny.\n",
            "Because in a movie about learning to fight kungfu, and that you should take geeks seriously, this is only to some extent endured.\n",
            "Besides, the character names are chosen rather uncreative, of course we have some good ideas, such as: Grand Master Oogway (Chinese for \"Tortoise\") or Master Shifu (Chinese for \"Master\"). But then we also have names like Tigress, Crane, Monkey, Mantis and Viper what the hell?\n",
            "It's probably one of my favorites in the DreamWorks catalog, definitely one of their best. It's an all around well made movie, with a good message to boot. Hopefully they can make more good films like this.\n",
            "Overall: One of Dreamworks' classics. Very good movie for children and adults.<br/><br/>Good: The story is very well told and actually pretty good. The animations is solid and very well done. Not photo realistic but a nice cartoony feel. All the the voice actors did a good job which isn't surprising considering the cast. I really enjoyed the fight scenes and appreciated the more cartoony feel about them as well. Most characters had interesting qualities, layers and a purpose. The movie is quite funny with a laugh-to-not ratio of about 7:3 which is pretty good.The prospect of animals performing martial arts is a great idea. Tai Long is a great villain and a 'worthy challenge' for Po. There is a lot of character development which is very very nice. I really liked the twist at the end.<br/><br/>Bad: Some jokes weren't funny and a lot of people won't find it funny. I think that Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen etc were conned as they have like 3-4 lines each in the movie. The only two of the Furious Five members I found interesting were Crane and Tigress. I also didn't like the restriction of only a few animals in the village. I understand they probably wanted to be accurate but I'm sure there are more than what was presented. Oogwat feels less of a character and more of a plot device so I would have liked to learn more about him.<br/><br/>Best Part: The training montage between Shifu and Po.<br/><br/>MVP: Dustin Hoffman as Shifu<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Silver\n",
            "I must have seen Kung Fu Panda, either in its entirety or snippets here and there, over 20 times since its release in 2008. While its relatively simple tale of an underdog who has been laughed at throughout his entire life learning to fulfil his unexplored potential is nothing new, it remains effortlessly entertaining and the kind of film you can catch halfway through and still enjoy what it has to offer. Although the title promises plenty of fat jokes, and there are certainly plenty, the film goes beyond simply appealing to kids with sight gags by working in Chinese mysticism, some wonderful voice acting, and stunning animation that would only get better and more ambitious as the series went on.<br/><br/>Clumsy panda Po (Jack Black) lives in the Valley of Peace, a scenic ancient land in China overlooked by the Jade Palace, home to the legendary kung fu masters. While he dreams of joining the Furious Five - a gang of ass-kicking kung fu specialists consisting of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) - Po spends his days making (and eating) noodles with his father Mr. Ping (James Hong). When he spectacularly enters the Palace during the choosing of the 'Dragon Warrior', Po finds himself picked out by the wise old Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) as the one to stop to the evil Tai Lung (Ian McShane), an escaped snow leopard seeking revenge on Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his Furious Five.<br/><br/>Taking inspiration from the Chinese kung-fu movies of the 1970's as well as American geek culture, Kung Fu Panda works as both as a physical comedy and an action spectacular. Although the characters frequently defy the laws of physics and seem incapable of getting hurt, the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting, with McShane voicing his role with whisker-twirling relish. There are also hints at backstories and questions raised about Po's past (why on Earth is his father a goose?), and the film is wise enough to leave the answers to future instalments and trusting in its simple introductory tale of a misfit finally finding a home. While the majority of the Five don't really find a moment to shine individually, Hoffman lends a certain gravitas to his tragic backstory and relationship with the deadly Tai Lung. The pratfalls will entertain the kids and the gentler moments will no doubt charm the adults, something that Dreamworks generally fails to do with its animated efforts, so it's no doubt that the series remains the jewel in it's crown.\n",
            "8\n",
            "I was almost dreading seeing this movie - we won tickets to the screener and from the first scene I found myself laughing out loud. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn't. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can't imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don't remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I'd like to see again.\n",
            "(Synopsis) Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, (voice Jack Black), a sweet, but clumsy Panda who has dreams of fighting with the legendary Furious Five and protecting the city against all threats. The only problem is that Po has no real life experience of kung fu, and his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodles shop. News of selecting the Dragon Warrior is sent out from the Jade Temple, and the whole city along with Po, go to the celebration. The competition is between the Furious Five: Tigress (voice Angelina Jolie), Viper (voice Lucy Liu), Crane (voice David Cross), Monkey (voice Jackie Chan), and Mantis (voice Seth Rogen). Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu (voice Dustin Hoffman) must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master, especially, after they learn that the snow leopard, Tai Lung (voice Ian McShane), is headed their way.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This is a cute animated comedy that also inspires lessons in life. The audience can relate to people who have dreams of doing the impossible, just as Po. Po ultimately learns that if he believes in himself, he can do anything. Jack Black (Po) and Dustin Hoffman (Shifu) voices were just right for their parts, and the chopstick fight between them is fantastic. Ian McShane (Tai Lung) was also wonderful as the villain, and his battle sequence on the rope bridge is spectacular. This film is for the whole family, because adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. (DreamWorks, Run Time 1:28, Rated PG)\n",
            "I hadn't got around to watching this film but as I'd heard good things about it I thought I'd check it out when it was on television. Initially I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it as I'm not really into 'talking animal' films; soon I was ignoring that and enjoying the humour and the story. The story itself is hardly new but tat didn't stop it being entertaining. Po is a panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu warrior fighting alongside the greatest warriors in China; unfortunately for him however he seems destined to become a noodle chef! One day the local kung fu master Oogway prophesied that a dangerous former student is going to escape from prison and return to seek his vengeance and steal the scroll that will make him the legendary Dragon Warrior. Oogway decides that he must find a new Dragon Warrior first; to this end he gathers everybody together to appoint the new warrior. Po is desperate to see the ceremony and in his efforts to see finds himself at the centre of the ceremony and being selected himself. Not surprisingly the five greatest warriors and their trainer are not impressed that a fat panda has been selected over them. When their enemy does indeed escape they head off to meet him while master Shifu attempts to train him. As is the way with such films Po finds that he has hidden depths and learns kung fu, the only question is will he learn the secret of the scroll and defeat the dangerous Tai Lung.<br/><br/>While the two films are very different I couldn't help thinking about Star Wars due to the relationships between the main characters; Shifu was like Obi Wan as his best student turns bad, Oogway was similar to Yoda. I'm not sure if this was a deliberate reference, it didn't matter if it was though as they never really laboured the point; in fact the film was refreshingly free from obvious pop culture references which I suspect will lead to it having a greater longevity than some other Dream Works animations. The animation looked pretty good in a way that made the characters believable even though they are talking, kung-fu fighting animals! The voice actors did a decent job; they avoided giving their characters 'cartoony' voices that can be a problem with animation at times. Over all I'd recommend this as it is a good family film with nothing too offensive for children or too childish for adults; it might not be as good as Pixar's best but then what is?\n",
            "When you watch Kung Fu Panda you can't help but wonder: why wasn't this done before? Kung fu and CGI make a terrific mix in this entertaining tale of a clumsy fat panda who becomes a true kung fu master. <br/><br/>The story in short: panda bear Po (voiced by Jack Black) is a big kung fu fan. He has all the action figures of his idols, Master Tigress, Viper, Tigress, Monkey and Mantis - also known as the Furious Five, and dreams of one day becoming a kung fu master himself. In the meantime he sells noodles. When evil leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) escapes from prison a Dragonwarrior is chosen to defeat him. Yes, our reluctant hero Po turns out to be the one! He gets a kung fu training from Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), who - after a few disastrous attempts - discovers that the only way to teach Po real kung fu is to lure him with food. But will Po be strong enough to beat Tai Lung?<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda doesn't start with a bang. The first laughs are results from the slapstick humour. Po is a lovable creature and everyone can relate to a person who dreams of the impossible. When Tai Lung escapes you're really into the story. This particular scene is pretty spectacular. It takes place in a dark cave and the way Tai Lung jumps around really gives you the impression that he's an enemy to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>What also works in the movie is the chemistry between Po (Jack Black) and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). The latter easily steals the show as the grumpy kung fu master who doesn't believe in his mission to guide Po. The scene in which Shifu has a food fight with Po is an instant classic. There's also a great action scene in which Tigress, Mantis and the others try to stop evil Tai Lung. They fail, of course... <br/><br/>And the down side? There aren't that many bad things in Kung Fu Panda. Hoffman and Black make the movie. The role of Tigress (Angelina Jolie) could have been done by many other voice actresses. Jackie Chan (Viper) only has three or four lines and that's a shame. The final fight is - at some moments - rather violent. That can scare away some of the younger (3-6 year old) kids. <br/><br/>Dreamworks wants to turn Kung Fu Panda into a Shrek like franchise. They're right. There's enough material in here to make at least two more sequels. And CGI animated kung fu kicks really work on the big screen! So let them make a Kung Fu Panda 2. As long as they keep Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu in the story!<br/><br/>8/10\n",
            "After the disappointing SHREK 3 and the only \"cute\" OVER THE HEDGE, DreamWorks Animation finally delivers another highlight to the CGI animated universe.<br/><br/>I got used to the rather simple story of MADAGASCAR after watching it again, I really liked SHREK and even more SHREK 2 (am I the only one?). I never liked the cultural references they built in, because I think they only work in their time (but in their time they worked great!). So for me KUNG FU PANDA is the first great \"classic\" DWA film. Go see it, it also works for adults. If you have seen some of the classic martial arts film (Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee etc) you will even more enjoy it. The voice talent of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane is perfectly used. The other voices are OK.<br/><br/>It will be a big hit for DWA, north of 200 millions domestic, eventually even 300 mil.<br/><br/>That said, my favorite CGI's are 1. THE INCREDIBLES, 2. RATATOUILLE and 3. FINDING NEMO and closely followed by KUNG FU PANDA. Looking forward to seeing KFP an second time and then maybe it will become my new Nr. 3.\n",
            "\"Kung Fu Panda\" is easily the best film ever made by the Dreamworks animation studio. It was even better than \"Shrek\" and \"Over the Hedge\" (Both very good films) The animation was quite well made: Not only the characters look more \"Alive\" than in many other CGI productions, but also the atmosphere looks stylish and more than adequate for the tone of the film. The characters were very likable and the action scenes were not only very funny to watch, but also were much better directed than other boring live action films like \"300\" or \"Pathfinder\". Jack Black was great in his role as the main character, and the cast did a great job as well. I highly recommend this film to anyone! It has fun, action and adorable and likable characters. This is one of the best films of the 2008, along with \"Wall-E\". <br/><br/>10/10\n",
            "If awesome fight sequences, crazy- mazing animation, and Funny humor are your thing GO SEE THIS MOVIE!<br/><br/>Who saw this coming? No one, everyone went into this movie thinking that it would be a stupid kid's movie (and personally I thought some of it was a bit too mature for the little kiddies in OUR audience) From one of the most incredible animated fight sequences, to a chaotic jail escape, to a dramatic bridge fight, to a hilarious final showdown.<br/><br/>Even though the movie does get serious at some points, it never takes itself seriously... did that make any sense? Jack Black is PERFECT in the role of Po the Panda, as are all of the other actors in their respective roles.<br/><br/>What's the only bad thing about this movie? THE TITLE! Who's gonna go up to their friends and be like \"Oh yea Kung Fu Panda was AWESOME!\" (oh yea, that's right, ME!) I originally said that Wall- E looks like the best animated movie of the year but I can now say that it has competition (Wall-E will still be the best, but it officially has competition)\n",
            "Watching this movie should easily explain why the Kung Fu Movie Genre simply refuses to die ever since movie technology was brought into China in late 1910s-- Kung Fu is essentially about self-cultivation, and so usually involves a human-interest story no matter how simple or complicated the plot is. And as others have noted, despite the lack of any real originality (Kung Fu Animals have been long existed in Chinese fantasy literature/ animation, see 1965's \"Uproar in Heaven\")-- Kung Fu Panda is done with such style and skill (or the Chinese would say, \"Kung Fu\") that it easily explains, again, why the Kung Fu Movie Genre simply refuses to die.<br/><br/>In a word, the whole \"Kung Fu Animals-imitating-humans-imitating-Animal styles Kung Fu\" gimmick WORKED (not to mention the comical sight of a Panda imitating other animals)-- because I was enjoying the detail and complexity of the Kung Fu Animation in much the same way I would enjoy the athleticism and aesthetics of real-life Kung Fu Action. And unlike some western attempts at Kung Fu Movies (most recently, The Forbidden Kingdom), Kung Fu Panda suffered less of the awkwardness in mixing foreign languages/ characters with Chinese languages/ characters-- because it is populated solely by animals (Peace Valley is basically a poultry &amp; pig farm/ community) and consistently set in fantasy/ mythical China (duh, there are Kung Fu Animals...).<br/><br/>So I will give Kung Fu Panda the honor of rating it as a Kung Fu Movie-- being rated \"G\" (in most Asian countries, \"PG\" in most western countries) is no excuse. MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS follow:<br/><br/>1) Most Missed-Opportunity Fight Scenes: Oogway vs. Tai Lung, Tai Lung vs. Peace Valley, and all the other \"flashback\" fight scenes-- we never really get to see how amazing or dangerous Oogway or Tai Lung can be.<br/><br/>2) Most Spectacular Fight Scene: Tai Lung vs. the Rhinoes-- things were blowing up and crashing down in a way which would have made Tsui Hark &amp; Stephen Chow proud.<br/><br/>3) Most Well-Choreographed Fight Scene: Po vs. Sifu-- truly a compendium of some of the best chopsticks moves in the Kung Fu Movie Genre.<br/><br/>4) Most Awesome Fight Scene: the Furious Five vs. Tai Lung-- it was just awesome to see the Furious Five teaming up in their only fight scene (the sparring scenes don't count), which would have been perfect if they had a chance to do Formation Fighting.<br/><br/>5) Most Fearsome Fight Scene: Tai Lung vs. Sifu-- the only \"serious\" fight in the movie, because both fighters were able AND willing to kill each other. Sifu would have died if this movie was made for an western adult audience (or made for/ by the Chinese).<br/><br/>6) Most Predictable Fight Scene: Tai Lung vs Po-- Po defeating Tai Lung with the use of natural and environmental advantages (ala Jackie Chan) actually took the \"edge\" off this climatic fight in favor of comic relief and made it look too easy for Po (Tai Lung has beaten everyone else), so much so that the final blow looks questionable. It might have worked with a (Hong Kong, not US) Jackie Chan or Stephen Chow for the right balance of comedy &amp; drama, but Jack Black's style of (over-)cockiness diminished any real sense of danger for me.<br/><br/>7) Most Unexpectedly Beautiful Scenes: the 2-D Opening Sequence-- because the \"distorted\" perspectives of ink-painting and shadow puppetry aesthetics actually work better in 2-D; and the almost monochromatic \"passing\" of Oogway-- because it was SO simple.<br/><br/>8) Most Unexpectedly Funny Scenes: \"I wish my mouth was bigger\" Noodle-scene, \"Maybe you should have another look\" Acupuncture-scene, and almost every one of the precious few moments given to Mantis (or any of the Kung Fu Masters at the temple)-- it was just unusually comical having them actually act/ talk \"normally\" (real Kung Fu Masters are usually quite sedate/ focused), instead of over-acting like Hollywood comedians.<br/><br/>My only gripe is that beside Po, none of the named characters such as the tortoise Oogway (Chinese for \"tortoise\"), the master/ teacher Sifu (Chinese for \"master/teacher\"), the tigress Tigress (erm, you get the idea), etc. were given enough screen time-- despite having more interesting personalities and back-stories than Po, the typical Kung Fu Movie protagonist (see Jackie Chan's late 1970's break-out Kung Fu Movies). A prequel about how the fastidiously over-achieving Sifu managed to warp Tai Lung into an unscrupulous over-achiever would be much appreciated... and yes, I smell a toy/ TV/ movie franchise.<br/><br/>Oh, and a final word about the beautiful Chinese landscapes and architecture-- well, I'm a bit hard to please cos I've seen &amp; climbed the real thing (looks to me like Tai-shan or Mt. Tai, with its 10 km stairway, mixed with various other parts of China)... but yeah, the animators did a GREAT job. ;)\n",
            "Po (Jack Black) is a panda who is a big fan of Kung Fu. Master Oogway is about to pick the Dragon Warrior when Po stumble into the ceremony. To the dismay of the Furious Five and Master Shifu, Po is picked the Dragon Warrior. Po is chubby, and inexperienced. When the powerful Tai Lung escapes from prison, everybody must battle to save the valley.<br/><br/>The animation looks great. Importantly, the characters are fun. Jack Black sets the tone, and he's perfect as Po. He's played the bumbling good nature fool before in other movies. As a cartoon character, he even more lovable.<br/><br/>The story is fairly predictable. It's really straight forward. The script doesn't have the modern references so prevalent today. It's not the most impressive part of the movie.<br/><br/>However the action is energetic. Po is hilarious. And the animation is cute. That's what makes this stand out among so many animated movie.\n",
            "This was a nice movie with likable characters but, frankly, I didn't find it anything memorable. Yes, it was beautiful artwork but I read where it was the most beautiful animation ever put on screen, and I didn't find it lived up to that. I guess my expectations were sky high, which made it almost impossible to meet. The story could have used more laughs, too. I think that was the main thing that slightly disappointed me: the humor was mild, not laugh-out-loud funny.<br/><br/>Having said all that, it was enjoyable and it will put numerous smiles on your face as you watch it. I guess \"pleasant,\" \"agreeable,\" \"warm,\" etc., would be better words to describe the film. It is pretty, too, especially on Blu-Ray. I imagine this looked awesome on IMAX in the theater.<br/><br/>Jack Black does a nice job of voicing the main character, \"Po,\" the panda that surprised everyone, including himself, on what he could achieve if he set his mind to it. That's another plus for the film: nice messages.<br/><br/>Kids should like this more than adults but grownups will enjoy it, too.\n",
            "This animation i have to say is one of the best i've seen and i'm not a fan of pixar type 3D animation (ie Find Nemo, Shrek etc...) since they're too much for kids. But this animation is worth the hype and the wait. Not only is it entertaining/funny but also has a moral to the story which we all should learn from (both adults and children).<br/><br/>The graphics is excellent, story is simple/typical (aren't majority of them nowadays) but the moral included makes this animation not only for kids but for everyone.<br/><br/>Generally i don't want any sequels to be made since they are just for money grabbing reasons but for this one i hope they make a trilogy since i really LOVE PO.\n",
            "Jack Black is on form with his latest outing 'Kung-Fu Panda' a funny and excellently animated tale of dreams, ambition, self belief and of course Kung-Fu. Po is a panda stuck in his job at his dads noodle shop but as he cooks and serves he secretly dreams of being a Kung-Fu master and part of crack fighting force 'The furious five'. Trained by Shifu the five are being groomed so one will become the Dragon master and protect the village from the wrath of the evil Tai Lung and in a hilarious set up that task falls to the reluctant Po. Cue comedy training scenes and 'Karate Kid' style balances on one leg as the clumsy and unfit Po tries to become the ultimate fighting force. With an all star cast of voice talent here, Black, Hoffman, Jolie and Chan to name but a few, the characters are instantly likable, but what sets this film apart is really the animation which is simply stunning and often uses matrix style slow motion to great effect as the camera whirls you round a fight scene that just stays the right side of not making you dizzy. The story despite being heavy on the morale of believing in yourself and you can do anything rhetoric is a strong one and the script is full of great jokes. Add to this some fun slapstick and it should have the adults laughing along with the kids. To quote Po 'there is no charge for awesomeness' well the price of a cinema ticket anyway, but I assure you its well worth it.\n",
            "After seeing the commercials on TV for this one, I didn't want to see it. It looked inane and more of a children's movie than one for adults. Today, though, my friend wanted to go, and I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the best movies I've seen this year. I was first struck by the art work... not the CG/animation but the artwork, the backgrounds and sets of the scenes. They're stunningly beautiful, as is the soundtrack. Then the story pulled me in, even the minor things like why a Panda has a goose for a father. I really liked the \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\"-type action scenes; they were really well done, using the characteristics of each character to add to what the character was able to do. The villain was especially well done, intimidating but not over-the-top scary that would scare small children. (There were many children in the theatre of course, but the movie kept them interested apparently because they were all well-behaved, engrossed in the movie.) The acting was well done as well. I'd wondered if Jack Black would be as funny when you can't see his physical humor, but I shouldn't have worried. I read a review of the movie this week that said Angelina Jolie wasn't very good. I'm not really a fan of hers, but I don't know what movie that reviewer saw; I thought she was great. In fact, I wish there had been more scenes and actions with the 5 Kung Fu warriors, the Monkey, the Snake, the Mantis, the Tiger and the Stork. They were all excellent as was the Kung Fu Master, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Hopefully, there will be a sequel (done as well as this one was) and we will see more of those characters, and find out about Po's father.\n",

            "A fun movie The action scenes in the movie were great, the five characters did not answer me, but the character of Poe was a wonderful and funny character, the villain in the movie was excellent for a children's movie, my problem with the movie was the lack of comedy in the film and the last fight that could have been better than Appeared in the movie I recommend watching the movie.\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is sort of a comedy/action film where the topic and the story is quite serious but is considered funny because of all the comedic stuff the characters do. We've had many movies similar to this with the talking animals and an unlikely hero, but then here we are where the animals must do kung fu and a snake(with no teeth) uses a damned ribbon as a weapon. And then there's the panda,who somehow ends up being \"the chosen one\" because a turtle points at him after he landed in front of someone else. It seems entirely ludicrous yet it somehow all works out. In my opinion this is a really great movie and they balance the comedy out with the serious and the fight scenes are pretty cool too. Overall this is a great movie which does deserve all of the attention it gets.\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is one of the best Dreamworks movies. Jack Black kills it, and the action scenes are actually really cool.\n",
            "I love this movie. Dearly love it. It's only flaw is that it has a little trouble balancing its comedy with its serious moments; while it has its charm, it sometimes detracts from the story.\n",
            "Aside from that, this movie has a broad theme about how teaching (mentoring, parenting) creates a reflection of yourself. This movie has heart spilling out of the seams, it's just... warm and fuzzy. And miles better than anything d*sney is currently trying to put out.<br/><br/>Animation 8/10 (You can see the improvement made in the second film, but still dang gorgeous)\n",
            "Writing 9/10 (the parallels and themes about parenting are just *chef kiss* -1 point for the sometimes unnecessary comedy)\n",

            "Another highly entertaining flick from Dreamworks. Jack Black played a clumsy fat Panda to great effect, and was nicely complimented by the other animal characters. The story was very predictable, but the animation, pacing and great action made up for it. I loved the action sequences, particularly those involving the villain. Out of them all, the 'escape' was probably my favorite sequence.<br/><br/>Though I wouldn't call it a classic, as it lacked the emotional touch of 'Nemo' &amp; Lion King etc, it is entertaining for adults and kids alike, though it kinda seemed a little violent for kids (but then who really cares these days!).\n",
            "From the time I was a little one to now, I have always loved movies and anything else with an Asian flair. From Mulan to Samurai Champloo, Asia's rich and interesting culture have always been in my must-have book, and I have loved them since childhood. Kung-Fu Panda takes an interesting look at this genre, as well as a modern one.<br/><br/>Po, a chubby, yet lovable Panda (Jack Black) works in a noodle shop with his Goose father (David Hong), but dreams of Kung-Fu and fighting with the Fearsome Five, a team made up of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen). When the old turtle sage Oogway announces a tournament for the selection of the Dragon Warrior, Po tries to attend, but, because of late arrival, is shut out. When he falls into the stadium after another failed attempt to get in, he is unwittingly selected as the warrior. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) is now faced with the task of training a panda with great knowledge but little skill in Kung-Fu. Meanwhile, the evil Tai Long (Ian MacShane) has escaped from prison, and is now threatening the village. Can Po live up to his new title and the dreams that keep him going? When the film was advertised, I became very interested. Seeing promo after promo peaked it. When I read the article on this film from USA today, I was surprised to see that a number of adults had gone to see it in the opening weekend! I figured, that's good enough for me, so I got my mom to take me to the theater to see it...and absolutely loved it. It is probably the best film from Dreamworks yet. The characters are what really draw you into the movie and the action/fighting sequences are expertly timed. The voice cast is perfectly cast. Jack Black plays our furry, chubby, kung-fu loving hero Po. Angelina Jolie is the bad-ass tigress who, although brash and thinks Po is a joke at first, is brave and learns to trust in her new comrade. Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Michael Clarke Duncan and Lucy Liu also round out the cast. The effects and animation also make the movie a must see!\n",
            "I hate talking animal movies and CGI movies so when you put those two together, it's usually a pretty bad combination for me. There have been a few exceptions like most of Disney/Pixar's films and now, Kung Fu Panda. I'm a big fan of kung fu movies and I think most fans will enjoy this movie because it seems to have been made specifically for those people.<br/><br/>The story and actually quite good and has a lot of heart. There are some really great action sequences, as well and they really captured the kung fu feel with this movie. I also thought the visuals were great which is rare, at least to me, in a CGI film. There are a lot of very good things about this film that almost everyone should enjoy.<br/><br/>Kung fu fans probably won't be disappointed with this one as I had a blast with it. I was expecting total garbage and actually am happy that I saw it. I'll be picking up the DVD when it comes out.\n",
            "After churning out mostly mediocre or rubbish animated films for years (SHARK TALE, the SHREK sequels, MADAGASCAR, BEE MOVIE), Dreamworks finally manages to release a piece that gets everything right from start to finish. It's apparent from the film's opening frame that a lot of care and thought went into the making of the delightful KUNG FU PANDA, and while the story is certainly nothing new  especially to those of us who live and breathe martial arts flicks  , it tells a familiar tale with a great deal of heart, enthusiasm, and respect for the viewer's intelligence while completely eschewing the anachronistic and largely inappropriate pop culture jokes that worked in the first SHREK and nowhere else since.<br/><br/>Po (voiced by Jack Black) is the fat son of a noodle chef who, though being groomed to take over the family business, has dreams of one day becoming a great kung fu master and hero of the people, but while quite game and enthusiast, he's lazy, clumsy, and has no skills whatsoever. The unlikely wannabe gets his shot at glory when the prophesied escape of the villainous and incredibly skilled Tai Lung (DEADWOOD's Ian McShane) looms imminent and a martial arts master must be named as the sacred Dragon Warrior in order to handle the threat. Po, quite by accident, finds himself awarded the vaunted title, much to the horror and dismay of the diminutive Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his balls-out badassed students, the Furious Five, each representing an embodiment of a classical animal-based kung fu style (specifically tiger, mantis, crane, snake, and monkey). All are dumbfounded that a fat load like Po could be the Dragon Warrior and all are at first determined to make sure that he gives up and leaves the temple, but they didn't expect Po's genuine love of what they do to fuel him to give it his best shot. While he's pretty much a washout, Po's girth and enjoyment of his training work to his advantage, and Master Shifu figures out just how to motivate his unwanted new student to greatness, all while his adopted daughter, Master Tigress (Angelina Jolie), seethes at the role that should have gone to her is usurped by one she feels is unworthy. As Tai Lung approaches and Po leaves the temple to accompany his father as the local villagers evacuate before the coming martial apocalypse, the Furious Five advance to stop him, but are unceremoniously handed their asses in a butt-kicking of painfully disheartening proportions. When Master Shifu, no slouch himself, proves unable to defeat Tai Lung  who, by the way, is also his adoptive child, one in whom he is deeply disappointed because he turned to evil  , Po returns to save the day after reaching a philosophical epiphany unwittingly provided by his noodle chef dad, providing the ages-old lesson of \"believe in yourself, and you can achieve miracles\" for a new generation of movie-going little ones.<br/><br/>I would have had a great time with KUNG FU PANDA even had I not been a devotee to the martial arts, so I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fun \"hero's journey\" or training film (a la the Shaw Brothers classic MASTER KILLER), as well as advising lovers of quality animation to see this on the big screen in order to get the full effect of its visual grandeur. As for the individual points of note:<br/><br/>* The one element of the film that I feared would make or break the film turned out to be quite praiseworthy, namely Jack Black's voice acting. I loved Black in the excellent SCHOOL OF ROCK, but find him mostly annoying in just about everything else he's been in because his approach to comedy often strikes me like he's both trying too hard and is attempting to convince everyone watching that he's as funny as he thinks he is. This time, though, he gives a genuine performance that is full of heart and charm, and the viewer definitely comes to love and root for his character.<br/><br/>* Dustin Hoffman was the last person I would have expected to be able to pull of playing that mainstay of kung fu movies, the seasoned master, but he's absolutely perfect as Shifu, a character whose triumphant martial abilities are reflected in Tai Lung's misuse of his teachings, and Master Tigress' feelings of resentment at being passed over as the Dragon Warrior. Shifu conveys as weary exasperation and sadness seldom seen in a character of this type, and I find him much more interesting than many of the master types found in the literally hundreds of martial arts films that I've seen. He's no Simon Yeung, or even Keye Luke for that matter, but he's nonetheless terrific.<br/><br/>* And speaking of terrific master types, Randall Duk Kim's ancient Master Oogway is the finest of this breed since Yoda first showed up in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980), before his mystery and wonder were permanently flushed down the toilet in the cinematic Montezuma's Revenge that was STAR WARS: EPISODES I-III. This centered, contemplative figure is a tortoise who's every slow movement conveys both his advanced age and now effortless mastery of his art, as well as his wisdom and connection with the natural world around him. He's even Shifu's master, and Shifu defers to his decree when Oogway pronounces Po to be the Dragon Warrior; Shifu has his doubts about that, but in the end Oogway is proved right beyond the shadow of a doubt. Truly beautiful in every way, I wish Oogway had more screen time.<br/><br/>So don't wait for KUNG FU PANDA to hit DVD or cable. Go see its plethora of visual storytelling wonders on the big screen as it was intended, and I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.\n",
            "Fortune cookie wisdom is imparted throughout the colorful KUNG FU PANDA. Some of it makes no sense out of context but it all amounts to some very simple, very basic advice about believing in the warrior within. \"There are no accidents,\" claims the coolest of Zen master turtles after a panda drops from the sky at just the right moment to be deemed the next Dragon Warrior. There are especially no accidents when no risk is taken. That panda is of course the panda from the title and from the moment this lazy emotional eater is \"discovered\" as the warrior that will go on to save the kingdom, you know exactly how the entire thing will play out. Po (voiced by an increasingly subtle Jack Black) will drown in doubt while he trains for something he doesn't believe himself capable of; the other animals will badger him into giving up; but eventually, he will find his inner kung fu master and save the day. Subsequently and expectedly, reviewers will call it out for its lack of originality. That's how it goes.<br/><br/>So it isn't so original. No big deal. What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in style and humour. Relatively new directors, Mark Osborne and John Stevenson have created a multihued ancient China that moves with stealth precision between enchantment and explosive energy. Its inhabitants are geese and rabbits that live their lives in the shadow of lore. As long as all is peaceful, then they can blissfully enjoy their noodle soups in the town square and if anything should happen to collapse that peace, then they have the kung fu specialized Furious Five  a tiger, a monkey, a crane, a snake and oddly enough, a mantis  to protect them from whatever evil lurks. No one member of the community has more faith in these five than Po. His idolatry of these heroes extends to numerous posters on his walls and action figures by his bed. Black plays Po as the hardcore geek that hides his enthusiasm and secret desire to be a part of it all in fear of being ridiculed for wanting the impossible. Po is that unfortunate fat kid from school that wants to hang with all the cool kids, hates that he's stuck working at the local fast food joint after school and knows that there's nothing he can do about it. Wait; was I that kid? Is that why I love him?<br/><br/>KUNG FU PANDA is overloaded with voice talent. Any scene with Po is usually hilarious as I guess Black knows what it's like to be the unlikely guy hanging with the in crowd. However, when he isn't in the picture, the delivery from the majority of the A-list cast is often bland and purely functional. Po, and his kung fu trainer, Shifu (a frustrated and disgruntled, yet still minutely optimistic Dustin Hoffman) trade quips with fervor and weight and make for much giddiness. The Furious Five, not so much. Considering they're voiced by actors as varied as Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen, you would think they would provide for plenty of conflicting antics but they end up reduced to nothing more than another obstacle for Po to overcome. I'm no kung fu expert but I'm pretty sure gossiping and bad mouthing members of the team when they aren't there (and sometimes even when they're right in front of them) is not part of the package. Our heroes aren't always what we hope they will be when we finally find ourselves face to face with them but these five could have certainly been truer to their furious form if some element of development had been given to them.<br/><br/>Still, despite its unevenness and seemingly simple approach, KUNG FU PANDA is great wisdom wrapped in even greater fun and often breathtaking animation. Sometimes the simplest of lessons are the ones that are hardest to learn. (Now I'm a fortune cookie.) Perhaps the subtlest lesson the film passes on is to relinquish your control over the destiny of your own life. Po never thought he would find himself surrounded by his heroes, getting the chance to realize his life long dream of becoming a kung fu master but here he is suddenly. Master Shifu never thought he would be training such a useless lump but here his is as well. It is only when each character let go of their egos and expectations that they saw how to make their situation work. Shedding your own expectation for KUNG FU PANDA to be something more than what it really is will allow for the good times intended to be had and an unexpected tranquility to seep into your mind.\n",
            "I have just seen Kung Fu Panda and I thought it was brilliant. Never seen this type of flick before. Excellent story, very impressive mystical music (reminded me of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), a lot of magic, martial arts (can I use this term for this film ?)are blended, great fighting scenes and funny moments. Fighting over a cookie was amazing ! When you watch this film you'll understand what I mean. The end is unpredictable and has a very pleasing finish.<br/><br/>This film's as different and unique as Cars or Shrek or Ratatoille when they came out. I was thoroughly entertained. I loved this movie. It's a must-buy DVD for your collection.<br/><br/>10/10\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is one of the better animated films of the year. Of course that's not saying much because most animated films are all about humor that is constantly in your face and is on the verge of being annoying. I went to see this on the recommendation of a friend which surprised me since he HATES kids movies like these nowadays. Walking out of this I can say that my friend was right as this really does deliver for a movie called \"Kung Fu Panda.\" <br/><br/>Now the plot is basically pretty generic. A panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu master, when he just sells noodles. One day he is chosen by the wise old turtle as the one who will stop a evil snow leopard. Then he basically goes through training for most of the movie. The plot is not the glowing part of the movie except their is some charm in seeing this buffoon, for lack of a better term, grow into a kung fu master.<br/><br/>No, what makes Kung Fu Panda shine is the action in the movie. And not only the action but the characters as well. I'm talking of course about the villain and the master. The villain in this movie may have seemed pretty generic, but he's the first villain in a long time that actually scared me. And also the old master is pretty well done too. But the action in the movie is spot-on. Some of the action scenes are really intense. <br/><br/>The humor in this movie was nice to because it was a departure from that piece of garbage that was Shrek the Third where humor was just out their in the open because it needed to be. None of this humor felt forced, and the opening sequence was just laugh out loud funny. <br/><br/>In short, see this movie and go in with an open mind. I'm guessing that you will be pleasantly surprised.\n",
            "9\n",
            "Like many others, I saw the \"trailers\" featuring Jack Black. The featurette made me think \"Okay, at least I got to check this out\". Not much more. It didn't make me think \"This is gonna be awesome\" or anything like that.<br/><br/>Boy, was I ever under-expecting.<br/><br/>At first I thought it was quite okay, decent entertainment and at least not totally crap. But then the really funny scenes and details kicked in, after Po gets into the temple. From then on, it was laugh after laugh, excellent voice acting, amazing CG animation (but this is Dreamworks so I expected that).<br/><br/>The whole deal simply hit home run for me. Spot on. I love martial arts movies, I love Dreamworks CG movies and I must admit I find Jack Black amazingly funny (saw Be Kind Rewind the other day and loved it). There was so much charm and amusement in this movie. It's without doubt the best animation from Dreamworks since the first Shrek.<br/><br/>Now, I am not saying this will be for everyone. There IS a lot of fighting going on, and while it is (for most of the movie) comical (yet amazing to behold) violence, it might not be suitable for the smallest of children. But for any healthy kid aged 6-7 or above (especially boys), this will be kick-a**! I cannot really put my finger on anything bad. Sure, the movie is filled with clichés, but sometimes you can go a long way with those. And this one serves them perfectly. I even rated this higher than Ratatouille, due to the fact that it took me totally by surprise. With Ratatouille, I EXPECTED it to be great. Kung Fu Panda I only expected to be decent, but it was awesome. That deserves the last point.\n",
            "I saw this movie in the Cinema last night. I can not recommend this movie highly enough to kids of all ages. it is a long, long time since i have heard a Cinema audience laughing so much during a movie ( i think the last time was during Gigli!).<br/><br/>Finally Dreamworks have managed to surpass the achievements of Pixar. All the elements are beyond anything i have seen in an Animated movie since The Lion King. the animation is hugely detailed and achingly beautiful, the script is the best i have come across in years. the only bum note in this symphony of fun is the fact that some of the immensely talented voice cast are badly underused. i can only remember hearing Jackie Chan's voice 3 times at most. having said that, the movie rests on the shoulders of jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. while playing their parts in a very different manner to each other, both are note perfect. they invest their characters with an energy (Black) and dignity (hoffman) that i could not find any fault with, even if i wanted to, not that i want to.<br/><br/>Lastly, i believe that Oogway is the best animated character ever rendered, his facial expressions are hilarious and-surpass any previous attempts to give a character convincing facial expressions (i consider Gollum to be a CG character, not an animated character, for the record).<br/><br/>in short, this is an utterly fantastic movie that everyone should watch 9/10\n",
            "Saw this movie today. It was both entertaining and imbibing good values. For kids a definite watch. For adults too.<br/><br/>The story is a well known moral story of don't judge by the appearance. It is about a Chinese town in the valley where a kung-fu rule is about to be seized by a evil spirited tiger who wants to become The Dragon Warrior, the great. And a Panda comes in his way to achieve it.<br/><br/>The script is very good. Dream works artwork team has proved one more time. It was very funny from the beginning to the end. And some philosophical moments too. The music and colors used in the movie reminds Chinese in every aspect and mainly kung-fu. It no way is lesser than ordinary kung-fu film. Kung-fu fight scenes drawn with such a clarity. Colors used are mostly red and yellow. Some flash back and magical related scenes have been drawn to bluish grey. The effects came out were extremely good. My credit goes to directors who could imagine the whole thing in their minds to make this film.<br/><br/>Animation films have been reaching new dimensions. Though this one did not create any new dimension but will be still one among the classics. Liked a few 'Zen'nish philosophical lines of the Master Turtle character such as 'there are no accidents'.. \"i am the big Panda'..'past is history... future is mystery... and present is the only gift you have that is why they call it as 'present'...they have most profound meanings which the film could casually spill it on its way.<br/><br/>Ver good movie. A must watch.\n",
            "Kungfu Panda is marketed mainly as a children's movie with very childish style of cartoon-making and Jack Black. But it turned out to be eccentric and wonderful, a good story to bring your family to. If the box office becomes a flop(which is already impossible), it should be attributed to the marketing only.<br/><br/>As the tag line says, \"Prepare for awesomeness.\" Even after so many positive comments, I still have no idea what the movie will come out like. One reason I couldn't figure out what the movie will be about is the super-simple title. Will it be just another Forbidden Kingdom? Or another Mulan? Or will it even turns out to be another Bulletproof Monk, which is among the disgraces to the Chinese culture? Sorry about this but I've seen too many movies portraying Chinese culture too superficial, which assumes Chinese philosophy established on either Buddhism(usually fake Buddhism) or some ridiculous superstition. So first of all, I am glad to say Kung fu Panda is the first Hollywood-made Chinese movie ever to make me feel proud for my ancestors' culture. If I haven't guessed it wrong, the writers really took some time digesting Chinese philosophies like the relationship between \"Beings\" and \"none-beings\", and other basic Chinese ideas about life and faith. No matter how old you are, the movie will make think for some time. It discussed some deep topics about human desire, confidence and destiny. After seeing it, I sincerely think that human desire can be used for good, for our bodies are like super-advanced machines and if you manage it in the right way, it won't be harder than controlling machines. Ancient Chinese assimilated so many nutrition from nature that they have a vision to achieve a balance between everything, that is also a reminding to me as a Chinese, which makes me proud.<br/><br/>The visual style of the movie completely beat my expectations. Everything is animated in a Chinese paper art style and the color red is so widely used as the main theme color. It touched me deeply because it reminded me of the glorious days of Chinese cartoons. It's like a combination of Matrix and traditional kung fu movies.<br/><br/>For many obvious reasons, it has the potential to win the Oscar. I am looking forward to some better cartoons this year. But at the same time I want Kongfu Panda to be the best animated feature of the year.<br/><br/>9/10 Almost excellent.\n",
            "I had the fortune of seeing this film the same day I saw another Dreamworks film in the theater--MONSTERS VS. ALIENS. Because of this experience, I think I enjoyed KUNG FU PANDA much more, as by comparison it was a much better film. In fact, though the Oscar folks would heartily disagree, I even enjoyed it more than last year's Oscar winner, WALL-E. That's because while these other films looked exceptionally nice, KUNG FU PANDA actually looked as good but offered a lot more entertainment and fun. Sure, it wasn't as deep as WALL-E, but it was enjoyable and didn't try to be a message film. And MONSTERS VS. ALIENS had a great idea, but the laughs were rather sparse.<br/><br/>The film is essentially a story about a young panda learning that he has a lot of heart and skills deep within--in other words, it was a lot like THE KARATE KID. But it also had a lovely artistry that I admired---the scenery and style looked very Chinese (although too many voice actors were non-Asians).<br/><br/>I could say a lot more, but now it's a year after the film debuted and there are a bazillion reviews already. Suffice to say that I was surprised that I liked this film so much--it made me smile and was fun from start to finish.\n",
            "One of the most wonderful animated films there are. I have always thoroughly enjoyed Kung Fu Panda, and this viewing was no different. In fact, I think I probably appreciated it more than ever.<br/><br/>The most striking thing about this film is how gorgeous it is. Every scene and all parts of the environment are simply stunning. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack, it has always been one of my favourite movie soundtracks. I feel like I had never noticed how beautiful this film is until now. One more reason to be happy that I watched it again.<br/><br/>If you have somehow managed to never see Kung Fu Panda before, I would obviously recommend watching it. Outside of some Disney animations and most of Pixar's work, this film remains my favourite animated film.\n",
            "I must admit I was a little skeptical going in to watch this movie, the main reason being, Dreamworks, in my opinion, has not produced a good movie since Shrek. By good movie I mean, a movie with a good story, heart, and humor. The Shrek sequels and other movies from the studio have all been corny and shallow, utilizing big name voices but with little in the manner of storyline and heart. Pixar, did exactly the opposite. Avoiding big names as much as they could except for where they felt it was necessary to help the storyline. Pixar put movie first, then voice actors. Dreamworks the reverse. And look at which company does better. Pixar of course! <br/><br/>A good friend told me that Kung Fu Panda was 'friggin Awesome', so I decided to take a chance. The trailers looked interesting. A little different from Dreamworks' typical approach of touting voices and funny scenes. Kung Fu Panda does have its fair share of voices, with Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, and Dustin Hoffman. But the trailers did not focus on the voices at all, which led me to believe that this might be something new.<br/><br/>So it started. I was mesmerized by the stylized opening sequence. I'm sure many an animator would take note of the work. It left me intrigued and interested. It also got me to smile and set me up for what was to come. The opening sequence is important. Make sure you don't get late and miss it.<br/><br/>The movie then switches into the normal style of 3D animation that we have become so familiar with in recent years. Kung Fu Panda has a lot of talking animals in it, and no humans at all. Jack Black plays Po, the Panda, who works in a noodle shop assisting his father (a goose?). He dreams of learning Kung Fu, and is a big fan of the fearsome five, a group of five animals who are experts within their animal talents. He is a true fan boy, and owns action figures of each of them. The story unfolds in a way that is not too unexpected. Po, our unlikely lovable hero, has to eventually defeat Tai Lung, and save everyone.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I found that the style of story had some similarities to Chinese folklore. The storyline intentionally encompasses Chinese culture and tradition to a degree. A rare thing to behold. I loved the effort.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda will appeal to all ages. For the young, the motivational message that comes towards the end. And for the older, an enchanting work of great entertainment. I was entertained.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is a good movie, and is reminiscent of the days when Dreamworks came up with Shrek. Now go see it and enjoy yourself!\n",
            "Well if your looking for a good time this movie is definitely for you..<br/><br/>The animation, CGI is done so well that even if I'm 20 i feel like an 8 year old watching a movie.<br/><br/>The humor made me laugh but more than that there was meaning and depth into the dialogue which makes this film a classic. <br/><br/>The voice of Jack Black paired up well with Po the Panda giving the movie a genuine feel.<br/><br/>\"There are no accidents\" And me giving this movie a 9 ain't no accident! <br/><br/>ENJOY!!\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is both a send-up of and a tribute to the kung-fu genre, and it works. Innocent eyes will goggle at the beautifully rendered characters, break-neck action, and gentle humor; more experienced viewers will laugh at loud at all of the kung fu movie clichés... a hopeless loser that goes from zero to hero in about one day of intense training... a promising but evil student who turns against his master... the wise, ancient master... the prophesy... the various forms of animal-style kung-fu practiced by actual creatures of the correct type... it's all there, without any wires, and without the awful dialogue you would expect from a chop-sockey film. Jack Black entertains, and shares some excellent dialogue with Master Sifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. The Furious Five, a group of powerful Kung Fu warriors, is voiced by various big-name actors, but somehow, they rarely seemed to get enough voice-time to justify those big salaries - particularly Jackie Chan (Monkey), who had about three lines of dialogue. Presumably they based Monkey's movements on some of Jackie's more inspired moves from the past. This is where the film lost a point. An honorable mention should be given to James Hong, who voices Po's (Jack Black, the Panda) father's voice - apparently, PO is the son of a goose who owns a noodle shop. Ian McShane also deserves mention as Tai Lung, the immensely powerful evil Snow Leopard kung-fu master who must escape from prison and return to the valley in order to fulfill PO's destiny. See this movie. It brought awesomeness back to a genre that has seen a lot of crap in the past 5 years (anything with Star Wars in the title, anything starring Jackie Chan, anything directed by the Wachowski Brothers...), and it's even clean enough to bring your kids to. And to any naysayers, I say to you... SKA-DOOSH.\n",
            "Went to see Kung Fu Panda on Saturday with very high expectations and I wasn't disappointed in fact, it was better than I thought. I was funny and it has a lot of action and adventure. It is also a movie that leaves you some valuable learning like \"never give up\" and \"always believe in yourself\". A very good story about an Enthusiastic, big and a little clumsy, Po is the biggest fan of kung fu around which doesn't exactly come in handy while working every day in his family's noodle shop. Unexpectedly chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy, Po's dreams become reality when he joins the world of kung fu and studies alongside his idols, the legendary Furious Five--Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey--under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu. But before they know it, the vengeful and treacherous snow leopard Tai Lung is headed their way, and it's up to Po to defend everyone from the oncoming threat. It is like a tribute to all those Chinese kung fu movies. The cast of voices is excellent, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen and Michael Clark Duncan all with awesome performances. In conclusion, this is one of the best movie of the season and the best animated DreamWorks movie since Shrek 2.\n",
            "This is one of my favourite animated movie! I've watched full series! I really enjoyed this movie\n",
            "This movie is funny, silly (in a good way) and really entertaining to watch, even for older people.\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda has always been one of my all time favorites. I was a little worried that the film would not hold up as well on multiple re-watches, but my conscience is reassured. This film is as good, if not better, than I remember it being.<br/><br/>Po's character is both hilarious and relatable. Jack Black's voice acting is astounding, and he really brings the character to life. The other characters are all well written and serve the plot well. I particularly liked Shifu and his arc in this movie. Oogway filled the wise old mentor role, with great quotes and life lessons. The Furious Five are funny and good side characters, although they could have been fleshed out a bit more.<br/><br/>But by far the best character in the film is Tailong. His motivations are understandable, he has an intimidating presence, and he makes for a formidable opponent. The part where he escapes from prison is one of the best villain establishing moments I've ever seen. Tailong then single-handily beats the Furious Five in an epic showdown.<br/><br/>Another important aspect that the film had to get right was the Kung-Fu fights, and I'm glad to say that it was quite mind blowing how well choreographed it was. Each battle had a purpose, and every punch or kick had a meaning behind it. It was also really smooth looking.<br/><br/>The message of the film isn't the most original, but it's executed beautifully, as both Shifu and Po understand the power of believing in something. The dragon's scroll is blank, and the way the characters react to it really highlights the difference between them. If you work hard and rightfully earn the scroll like Po, you see yourself in it and can understand that the true power comes from within. And if you chase after the scroll desperately, sacrificing everything for it, like Tailong, then you're forced to reflect at yourself and see what you've become.<br/><br/>I also love the color palette of the movie. During Tailong's scenes the sky is usually dark and red, but whenever Po shows up it turns yellow. There's a nice little attention to detail, and plenty of call backs at the end that you'll notice if you pay attention closely. This is a movie that is especially rewarding upon re-watching. Kung Fu Panda is a story that will entertain kids and please adults, it will make you laugh and stare in awe, and as soon as it's over you will want see it again.\n",
            "\"Kung Fu Panda\" hits all the right notes of a terrific animated movie: gorgeous artwork, engaging story and characters, and it's made for everyone - big and small.<br/><br/>The titular character is Po (Jack Black), a roly-poly panda with over-sized ambitions to match his girth. Stuck in his workaday job as a noodle-pusher, Po's biggest dream is to be a kung fu master and join the Furious Five, China's legendary superhero team (Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Seth Rogen). Po is thrown headfirst into training when a prophecy names him the new Dragon Master, to the chagrin of the Five's master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Meanwhile, the imprisoned Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped, lusting for vengeance against Shifu, his former master. As the nigh-unstoppable escapee approaches, everything rests on the unlikely Kung Fu Panda.<br/><br/>Steeped in Chinese mysticism and showcasing the breathtaking mountainscapes of the Far East, \"Kung Fu Panda\" is a film that is impossible not to like. The frenetic action scenes come fast and furious, while the quiet moments are stocked with inspirational Chinese proverbs and characterization. Much of the humor - and there's plenty of it - centers around the comically overweight panda as he faces off against his kung fu superiors.<br/><br/>And Jack Black has found the perfect character for his trademark brand of overwrought hyperactive comedy, which usually borders on obnoxious. But here, it completely fits with the Panda who won't quit. Po is full of heart (as is the film), and his boundless energy and need to reek of awesomeness just makes him one of the most likable characters I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And the whole movie is just as likable. No, scratch that.<br/><br/>Lovable.<br/><br/>9/10\n",
            "This movie is entertaining and well thought out in many levels. In the most reductive form, its the story of a Panda(an unfit animal for training Kung Fu?) who wants to be a Kung Fu fighter. The movie is about how he eventually gets there, and that he does against many odds in a very entertaining way. That is the inspiring part of the story.<br/><br/>If you look a little bit more deeply, we see that the 5 animals that are currently training to be the dragon warrior are monkey, crane, tiger, snake and mantis. They are not chosen by co-incidence, but these are the famous five animal fighting styles taught in Kung Fu.<br/><br/>When the funny panda goofs up and unwittingly puts himself in a spot where he gets picked for the dragon warrior, master Shifu is not thrilled, and he does not believe that the panda can be a dragon warrior, and he is determined to make the panda give up and leave. But wise Oogway has faith in his selection. Eventually, master Shifu has to accept the fact that he has to train the panda to be a dragon warrior and in that process Shifu has to relearn his teaching methods as well.<br/><br/>After intense training the panda has proved he is worthy and gets to open the dragon scroll, and here is where it reaches a philosophical zenith. When he opens the dragon scroll, he is supposed to see something special that is supposed to give him an advantage over his enemy, and what he sees is an empty scroll with a reflection of his face! The message indirectly conveyed is to have faith in oneself or, that if you truly believe in yourself you could be special, i.e you could achieve the impossible! Panda learns this(the meaning of the scroll) only later when he tries to find out what makes his dad's soup so special!<br/><br/>Everybody else (furious five and Shifu), see the scroll as well, but however, it was only the panda who figures out what the empty scroll means. He tries to explain to Tai-Lung as to what the meaning of the scroll is, Tai-Lung does not see the meaning and thinks he is being tricked which eventually leads to his own destruction!<br/><br/>Some of the core philosophy behind Kung Fu, is drawn from Buddhism. I cant help drawing a parallel between a famous saying originating from Buddhism- it says \"Before Enlightenment chop wood carry water, after Enlightenment, chop wood carry water.\" The difference is only in the frame of mind. Analogous to that, even here after seeing the dragon scroll, panda only had to change its frame of mind to be special.\n",
            "I was very entertained by \"Kung-Fu Panda\". This movie ranks among Dreamworks Animation's best along with \"Shrek\", \"Shrek II\", and \"Antz\". The animation as a whole was excellent, including the fantasy sequences that took the form of supposed 2D animation. Even when the animation was 3D, the animation had everything down to a T from the blades of grass to roof shingles to animal's fur.<br/><br/>Of course, since 3D has now become the norm for animated movies, I know that 3D animation alone cannot save a movie. For instance, \"Doogal\", \"Shrek The Third\", and \"Shark Tale\" (which also featured the voices of Jack Black and Angelina Jolie) were big disappointments for me. Fortunately, there was enough good comedy, great action sequences, and intriguing characters to keep me entertained and to rate this movie as the best to come out of this summer so far.<br/><br/>For starters, Jack Black was perfect as Po the Panda. In my opinion, Black was underused in \"Shark Tale\", which was probably why I didn't like that movie so much. Here, he brings his great comic timing and a touch of his Tenacious D personality into this panda character. He especially works very well in the training sequences with Head Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). I thought it odd that his character was the only panda in a story set in China, but I won't get too picky.<br/><br/>The actors who played the Furious Five were also well cast. Angelina Jolie was a natural to play Tigress, who is probably the first truly strong female character in animation history who also isn't involved in a love story subplot of a film. I actually found myself relieved that they left such a subplot out and just concentrated on a great story.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint against the movie, it's that the other four fighters weren't as focused on as they should have been. Yes, there's only so much you can fit into a 90 minute movie, but the snake (Lucy Liu), crane (David Cross), praying mantis (Seth Rogen), and monkey (Jackie Chan) all individually made such intriguing characters. Indeed, this is one of the few animated movies I've seen that merits a sequel, and I hope that all four of them are focused on in that other movie should it come along.<br/><br/>Otherwise, that's my only complaint against the movie. It just worked so well otherwise. Other than the mostly American voice-overs, the movie stayed true to a traditional Kung Fu movie by the likes of Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba, and also had elements of spaghetti westerns and other movies such as \"Star Wars\". None of that would have been complete with a great Darth Vader-esquire villain like leopard Tai Ling (played by lesser known actor Ian McShane), and an even better Yoda-esquire mentor like tortoise Ancient Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). This is an altogether incredible movie that I personally can't wait to purchase on DVD. I may even see it again in theaters, and there are few movies that make me want to do that.\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda Rated: PG Time: 1:31 Stars: The voices of such notables as: Dustin Hoffman, Jack Black, Lucy Liu, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and others Final Grade: B+ Overview Summary: This is an animated story of a fat panda, that in his dreams longs to be a kung fu hero, being thrust into his role in destiny to save his village and valley from an ancient and evil foe. If kung fu fight scenes bother you, be aware that there's lots of kung fu action (which some chose to avoid - so fair warning) as well as lots of laughs and action for both kids and parents alike.<br/><br/>This is a family oriented movie, given the fighting scenes, and my family and kid really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The final moral of the story is that the secret to true greatness is found inside of one's self and that you can achieve the greatness you seek if you want it...but a lot more than that happens in the hour and 31 minutes that this film runs.<br/><br/>Now The Details: Our movie opens with a fat lazy panda dreaming of being a great kung fu warrior and saving the world from the throws of evil through his fighting skills and those of the other major fighting skills personified by the crane, snake, monkey and in this case tigress. He then wakes up to the reality of his own peasant life in the family business.<br/><br/>But, as his luck would have it, there's a contest in the village to determine the warrior who will be chosen to defend everyone from a recently escaped evil villain.<br/><br/>By a most humorous stroke of luck, our hero to be is chosen to be the one to defend the village from the evil one. Needless to say, he's as shocked as the heir apparents' are.<br/><br/>There's some good laughs and moments during his rushed training and acclimation to the rest of the group and alas his time to prove himself comes through as he and the bad guy square off to fight over who gets the golden scroll with the all powerful secret message inside.<br/><br/>You can basically guess who wins but what's interesting is that, at the end, the moral that a person's inner self is what determines their own success and that you can do and be whatever down inside you set you r mind's goals to be.<br/><br/>This movie is clocked full of animated action and fighting scenes, lots of humor and 1:31 of family fun.<br/><br/>Enjoy this one with the family and the kids may be talking about it for days.<br/><br/>And that's the I saw it, From Where I Stand.<br/><br/>( The writer is a regular contributor to www.fromwhereistand.info )\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is a remarkable film. From the horrid title, you go into the movie expecting some cheap rip off of the Jackie Chan movies. But only a short ways into Kung Fu Panda, you realize that it is a truly beautiful and well done movie. It mixes smart (and yes, sometimes stupid) humor with beautiful rendered and artistically proficient scenes.<br/><br/>Still, the plot (more so \"theme) is atypical for the genre (the old \"underdog\" theme), and the movie at times seems like it wants to fall back upon overused animated movie tools. But this should not deter you at all from the movie. It's stunning in every aspect.<br/><br/>The voice acting? Incredible. Jack Black is truly wonderful as Po, and all of the other actors do a superb job (Angelina Jolie was Master Tigress?! I didn't even know that until the credits.). Sadly, the only character that sounds truly Chinese is the Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan. You cannot make a good kung-fu movie without him).<br/><br/>Music? Lets just shorten this by saying it deserves an Oscar nomination (or winning *hint hint*) Now I HAVE to wrap up this by writing about oogways death scene. I am truly amazed to say I cried over a dead turtle. And I don't even cry at the end of sad movies! But the pure beauty of this scene is just so moving, even the hardest heart will soften. The music is very wonderful (although I will say I'm glad they refrained the catchy, but god awful \"kung fu fighting\" song to the credits).<br/><br/>Go and see it. You'll see it more than once.<br/><br/>You must believe.\n",
            "This movie was incredible the story was great the animation was awesome.<br/><br/>I own a karate school and we had a preview tonight 2 days before it hits theaters and it was absolutely awesome!!!!! <br/><br/>The kids had a great time, the adults loved it!! <br/><br/>This movie will become an instant classic like shrek and others in that class!!! <br/><br/>The comedic timing was really good and pertained only to the movie. No weird out of the film references, no really bad martial arts movie genre pieces put in. The comedy is slap stick based but that is what appeals to most kids and this is a kids movie per say.<br/><br/>Anyone who is a martial arts flick buff will love this young or old!<br/><br/>Only thing that leaves to be desired that prevents it from being a 10 is character development on the furious 5..... however the character development of the masters, PO and the bad guy tai lung was excellent!\n",
            "In recent years Dreamworks animation has been a sort of hit and miss production company. Some of their films have been nearly as good as the Pixar films (Shreks, Over the Hedge), but others have been close to complete crap (Shark Tale, Madagascar, Bee Movie). With 'Kung Fu Panda' Dreamworks hits the jackpot.<br/><br/>The film is great because of how simple it is. Simple story, simple morals, simple (but very effective) comedy, and simple style. The movie is just good to watch. You could go and see it with your family, or your best friends---its a neutral sort of movie.<br/><br/>Jack Black was the by far the best choice for the main character, Po, and you REALLY get a sense of the real Jack Black. He is such a passionate soul in most of his movies---this is especially highlighted in 'Panda.' Apart from having a simple and intriguing story, the movie has some legit fight scenes. Scenes that could only be made with animals shown in the film.<br/><br/>Honestly, this is a great movie. If you want to feel good about going to see a movie by yourself, with friends, family, a girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever---truly, this is a great choice. DO NOT think this movie is just for kids, because it really is not.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is a clever, refreshing, and entertaining flick. It may very well be the best movie in theaters right now.<br/><br/>Excellent.\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po (an overweight, underachieving panda) who spends his days serving noodles at his father's restaurant and his nights dreaming of kung fu greatness. When the wise Master Oogwei (a tortoise) foretells the return of a deadly warrior who is bent on exacting revenge on their village, he and Master Shifu (a red panda) must find the fabled Dragon Warrior who is destined to save them all. Much to everyone's surprise, and seemingly by accident, Master Oogwei chooses Po. With entire village's fate in his hands, Po must face the countless doubters all around him as well as the doubt in his own heart.<br/><br/>Though I was excited to go see this movie, I had some reservations. Jack Black's bumbling-yet-lovable shtick can be too much at times, and as a starring actor he can be rather polarizing. I'm happy to say that he blew me away in his role as Po. The part was clearly written for Jack Black and is very much in keeping with his personality, but rather than bringing out that annoying side of his, here he was nothing short of absolutely endearing. I suppose it doesn't hurt that Po is a roly poly panda bear, but Jack Black injected the character with so much heart and soul that you couldn't help rooting for him from the very start, no matter how hopeless it seemed. Indeed, he had the audience laughing out loud by the end of the very first line.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman shines equally in his role as Master Shifu, the kung fu master charged with training Po in the art. While Po is clearly flawed, Shifu is just as insecure and uncertain due to past tragedy, and he too must learn to trust that destiny will right things in the end. A number of other well-known talents voiced the roles of the Furious Five, a team of warriors trained under Shifu. The Furious Five are all Dragon Warrior hopefuls (as well as Po's idols), until Po is picked over them. It was fun to recognize their voices (Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Lucy Liu as Viper, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Jackie Chan as Monkey, and David Cross as Crane), but their roles were largely unexplored. That's okay, I was so entertained by the developing relationship between Po and Shifu that I wasn't much interested in the rest of them. Other memorable supporting parts were the roles of Po's noodle chef father (who is, inexplicably, a goose), the prison warden (an imposing rhinoceros voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan), and Master Oogwei who was reminiscent of a softer, gentler Master Yoda and is brought to life so beautifully by Randall Duk Kim.<br/><br/>The story itself is simple and predictable (and, as some critics have been quick to point out, clichéd), but it is told so well that I can't think of anything I would have changed. Obviously there is an element of the fantastic, but the plot is woven together so seamlessly that it is easy for small children to keep track of and yet interesting enough to keep adults on the edge of their seats. Speaking for myself, there were several scenes that had me biting my nails with anxiety, and others that brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Many of the laughs involved classic references to the martial arts movie genre. Having grown up in a household where martial arts movies were a big part of family movie nights, I can tell you that the writers definitely did their homework. Once again, critics will complain that they just recycled old clichés, but that's the point. Anyone who is a fan of old kung fu movies will appreciate how well researched this is. Honestly, anyone who complains of this as being \"unoriginal\" is probably the same kind of movie critic who will complain about there being too much singing and dancing in a musical. It's part of the genre, so love it or leave it. <br/><br/>Lastly, the animation was absolutely incredible. Dreamworks really outdid themselves here. The characters' movements were graceful and fluid... well, maybe not Po's so much, but you get what I'm saying. This was absolutely vital in a movie that features so much movement, and the animators did a wonderful job. There was also such incredible attention to detail. I'd like to watch the movie several times over just to take it all in. And the way they captured the treacherous beauty of the Chinese mountain ranges was breathtaking. Several scenes looked just like Chinese watercolor paintings.<br/><br/>In closing, I'd definitely recommend this movie to viewers of all ages looking for a movie that is hilarious yet moving, and visually stunning. The whole audience laughed and cried together, and the experience reminded me of why some movies have to be seen in theaters.\n",
            "One of the best animated films I've seen in a long while. Dreamworks is finally showing it can overcome the mediocrity of movies like Shrek, Bee Movie, and Madagascar, and put out a film that is not only fun, but shows excellence in animation as well. The CG animation easily stands up next to Pixar's work, and even the 2-D animated opening was beautifully done. I would've loved to see them even do the whole film in that style.<br/><br/>Plenty of laughs to be had for audiences of any age. A truly enjoyable movie and likely the best animated film we'll see this year. (Sorry, but Wall-E isn't doing anything for me so far)\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda, when I saw this trailer, I have to admit, it looked pretty lame, it just seemed like a typical CGI kids film that wouldn't be much fun for the grown up's and like it would be forced humor. But I decided to go ahead and see the movie today, I'm so glad that I gave it chance because this was such an enjoyable film not just for me, but the kids as well. As I looked around the theater, everyone was just having so much fun watching Kung Fu Panda, the jokes, the animation, the voices, the story, I felt like I was watching real kung fu movie. The action sequences were so exciting and you couldn't help but just cheer for the warriors. I loved how the animals represented all the kung fu movie: the viper, the tiger, the praying mantas, the monkey, the crane, and the panda. This movie is just so much for the entire family to watch.<br/><br/>Po is a panda who is just dreaming of one day to learn kung fu like his idols, the fantastic five, but his father wishes for him to take over their noodle restaurant. Bu when Oogway has a vision and tells Shifu that he is having a vision of Tai Lung, a student gone evil, is about to come back, he picks the \"dragon warrior\", which is Po. But Shifu sees Po as well as the fantastic five, they're all disappointed and don't believe in him. But after Tai Lung escapes, Shifu has to learn to believe in Po and help him with the strengths and the \"secret ingredient\" that he has.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is one of the year's most fun and entertaining movies that anyone could enjoy. I know that most of Dreamwork's cartoon films are not always as memorable as the Disney and Pixar combination, but they do pull out some great films. I just loved the scene where Shifu is training Po how to fight and they realize that it is food that is Po's strength, the fight for a dumpling was just so much fun and incredibly entertaining. I really enjoyed Kung Fu Panda with a passion, it's a big recommendation, it has great comedy, and some really terrific characters that will all get you in the mood for some kung fu fighting. Not to mention: Jack Black, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, and Lucy Lui, plus many more, how could you not love a cast like that? Believe me, this is a fun movie.<br/><br/>9/10\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda - Po the Panda (Jack Black) must somehow become a Kung Fu Master in order to save the Valley of Peace from a villainous snow leopard, Tai Lung. Set in the legendary world of ancient China, it features the voice talents of Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and Jackie Chan (kind of).<br/><br/>At first glance the movie looked like a pass, mostly because of a crap title and Jack Black's less than good batting average lately. The kung fu genre has also kind of been mocked and done to death. This is the day of CGI and the superheroes.<br/><br/>But this movie, on the whole, is delightful. It is funny and cool, and not in a topical way. It also stays away from the usual fart and pee jokes that movie execs push in when they can't admit they don't know what kids like these days. No. This movie is actually honest to goodness funny. It's also got some very good action sequences, and doesn't do the same tired montages we've seen before. Po learning shaolin in a couple days seems to go down a lot smoother than Daniel-san winning a karate contest after a week of manual labor, because of the excellent decision to do this in cartoon format, and because of Po himself. <br/><br/>There hasn't been quite this good a protagonist in an animated film in awhile. Po is a goodnatured but cowardly and overweight nerd, just like most martial arts nerds. He's the sort of guy who worships the martial arts, like me and my friends used to (hell, still do), but never had the time or discipline to learn (1 year of Aikido and 3 months of Tae Kwon Do for me. Nothing stuck). Speaking of martial arts, the movie doesn't shy away from the action either. There's about as much awesomeness as a PG cartoon can get away with. The animators did an excellent job. Of course this movie treads on familiar ground (\"believing in yourself\" etc etc). It's a labor of love towards the martial arts and an attempt to keep their spirit alive.<br/><br/>Jack Black plays it just right without going overboard like he's prone to do, and the result is one of my favorite characters in their extensive movie list. Dustin Hoffman plays sound support as the Red Panda Master. Seh Rogen is hilarious and Ian McShane always plays a good villain as the Evil Leopard Tai Lung. It was a pleasant surprise to hear Michael Clarke Duncan and David Cross as well.<br/><br/>I'll probably purchase the DVD for this one. A truly pleasant surprise from a movie I expected little from about a panda nobody expected anything from, Kung Fu Panda gets an A-.<br/><br/>(now don't get greedy an make a sequel now. I had to endure trailers for Madagascar 2 and Pink Panther 2 to get to this)\n",
            "Go. See. This. Movie.<br/><br/>First of all, thank God for an animated kids movie with no fart jokes in it! The humor is cute, satirical, ironic, or slapstick, but not cheap or vulgar.<br/><br/>And don't worry about being too old for this movie. I'm 49, and I, my wife, my 18 y.o. son, and my 21 y.o. daughter all thought it was great! I was *rolling* on the floor at some of the dialog and situations. In the opening scene, Jack Black begins \"Legend tells of a legendary hero whose kung fu skills were the stuff of Le-Gend-uh\" - classic!<br/><br/>I think the re-watch potential for this movie is really pretty high, even for adults - there are nuances and jokes in throwaway lines and in the edges of the screen, that bear looking for in 2nd and 3rd viewings.<br/><br/>And at times, just sit back and admire some of the most beautiful scenery animation - the scene of Po under the Peach Tree of Wisdom as the camera pans back holds just long enough for you to just look and admire the artistic work that went into this movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - this is hardly \"film\" - but definitely \"an enjoyable movie to enjoy with great enjoyment,\" as Po might say.<br/><br/>(Tip: try to go to a show that is past most small children's bedtime - some of the little kids at our showing lost it at the 1 hour mark, most kids can sit still for only so long.)\n",
            "10\n",
            "I really wasn't expecting much, other than a few laughs, which would have been OK for a Dreamworks animation movie. But KUNG FU PANDA exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The voice-overs are really good, esp Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. The action sequences are breath-taking. The laughs are mixed in at the appropriate moments. The theater was full and it was composed of a mixture of Adults and young kids. This is a fun for all movie. A testament to this fact is that almost the whole crowd stayed for the end credits. This is a very rare occurrence nowadays.\\<br/><br/>Oh.. and I hope this does not count as a spoiler. I absolutely loved the Samurai-Jack type animation for some scenes.\n",
            "One of the best comedy movies I've seen, this animation feature is both packed with action and intelligent at the same time. It's yet another variation on \"You can do anything if you believe in yourself\" and carries strong morale and educational message. But the way it's done, the incredible visual side of the story, as well as the dialogs, is just exceptional. You can't but love the fat Panda boy who's dreaming about being the greatest warrior of all China only to wake up to the reality of hawing to serve noodle soup in his father's shop. Unlike his father, who also dreamed but never found the courage to act on it, Panda follows his calling and by \"luck\" get chosen to be the legendary Dragon warrior by the Kung-Fu grand master, the old turtle, to defeat the evil tiger. That's when his training and troubles start. It's really for anyone between 3 and 100 and I laughed and loved it from the titles in the beginning to the very end. Much recommended.\n",
            "After various 3D animated movies ranging from lacklustre \"star\" movies (\"Madagascar\"), boring tripe (\"Shark Tale\", \"Bee Movie\"), and over-rated, over-hyped overkill (\"Shrek\"), Dreamworks can finally be proud of a truly great film. (Sidebar: I actually enjoyed \"Flushed Away\" and \"Over The Hedge\".) First, the bad. If I could complain about ANYTHING it may be a few of the voices. Besides Po, Shifu and Oogway, the rest of the cast seemed pretty 'phoned-in'. Thankfully, those characters are pretty inconsequential so they're not really missed.<br/><br/>Now the good... or rather great. While classic kung fu movies are poked fun at, Kung Fu Panda does an excellent job of treating the genre with great respect in a movie geared towards kids. And while it IS kid friendly, it is not dumbed down to the point where it's childish. All the classic elements of those great kung fu flicks are there, while still keeping it pleasantly G-rated.<br/><br/>Let me get this out of the way: this movie has some of the greatest 3D animated fight scenes. Ever. What elevates them from good to great is that while I expected the unbelievable, gravity-defying stunts that are REQUIRED of a good kung fu movie, there is an amazing amount of 'realism' to the physics in this movie. Just watch the jailbreak and you'll understand.<br/><br/>Speaking of animation, the cinematography, character design and backgrounds are all done very, very well. Whether it's flying through the air alongside a leaping character, the painting-like backgrounds, or the wonderful opening sequence (reminiscent of Samurai Jack), they're all beautiful. Snap zooms, slow-motion, and flying cameras are also used with great skill to further the experience.<br/><br/>Even the music and sound is outstanding. Asian drums rumble in the background of intense fights... stones shatter and crumble away... fight sequences rise and fall with each of the music cues, or is that the other way around? Beautiful.<br/><br/>What helps make this a new classic in my eyes is what it doesn't have. There are no Matrix, Spiderman, or other dated references. There are no inside jokes related to the voice actors. There isn't even any double entendre or unnecessary crude humour. Much like \"Finding Nemo\" or \"Monsters Inc\", there's just plenty of pop-culture-free goodness that is terribly entertaining.<br/><br/>The last great part of this movie is often the most overlooked part of a good family film... heart. This movie has oodles of it. Other movies have tried to have a lesson in the end like 'be yourself' (\"Shrek\"), or 'the value of friends' (\"Madagascar\"), or... 'be yourself' (\"Shark Tale\"), but \"Kung Fu Panda\" has genuine cinematic moments with dialogue that carries real weight. Best line: Oogway regarding yesterday, tomorrow and today.<br/><br/>So, finally, as a complete sucker for Pixar animation, I'm glad that another animation company can actually put proper thought and execution into a FAMILY movie. What else can I say? Congratulations Dreamworks. 10 out of 10.\n",
            "From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/>I took my wife and nephew and niece to see it on a Friday night and they enjoyed it, too! We were totally laughing, smiling, and guffawing at Po, the main protagonist (voiced by Jack Black) and his misadventures at becoming a Kung Fu expert. This was certainly a flawed character, one that a lot of people can relate to because he dreams, he's funny, and he can laugh at himself. Also, the story was pretty clear and easy to follow because the storytelling was well crafted, and the animation was paired well with characters brought vividly to life by some of the most famous names in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are downright excellent as the main characters, and Ian McShane as the bad dude gave it the right fearful presence. Other big name stars don't shine as much, but that's because their roles are rather limited in the film. But that's still okay because the animators should be given equal credit (if not more) for delivering the funny, action and heart elements of this movie in an effective, amazing and (I've got to use this) AWESOME manner. Visually, this movie is stunning (notice all those scenic shots of the Chinese mountains, bodies of water, and the bridge scene; not to mention the action animation version of \"The Matrix\" with slow-mo)... simply a delight to watch.<br/><br/>It's clear that Dreamworks has gotten back in the animation game with Kung Fu Panda, after slight ho-hums in Shrek 3 and Bee Movie (call me crazy, but I liked Over The Hedge more than those two). Hopefully, it should earn well over $500M worldwide because it is so good.<br/><br/>This movie rightfully belongs in the top animation movies of all time (okay, let's not include the classic fairy tales of old; let's begin with the 90's onwards), alongside my faves \"The Incredibles\" \"Finding Nemo\" and \"Beauty &amp; The Beast.\" Has the makings of being a classic.<br/><br/>My wife and I enjoyed it so much that we saw it again the night after. And maybe another time... haha!<br/><br/>Enjoy!\n",
            "Take it from me, this movie is brilliant. Don't go by it's silly child-pandering name, this film is for everybody. From little kids just looking for some simple fun for a little while to adults looking for a more compelling experience that makes you feel for the characters, this one's for everyone. Funny action adventure with some wise words scattered throughout.\n",
            "Caught a screening of \"The Panda\" and all I can say is wow! I took my 6 year old daughter, who has the attention span of a 6 year old, and she wants to see it again. So do I! <br/><br/>Jack Black is not only half of the greatest band in the world, he is also a fine voice actor. His flawed character, Po the Panda is very refreshing. So is this film. After having to sit through the boring \"Over the Hedge\" and the last two \"Shrek\" messes, I really appreciated an animated feature form Dreamworks that didn't have too many celeb voices all competing for screen time. This is Jack Black's movie. He has 75% of the lines in the script and that is not a bad thing. <br/><br/>Don't just drop the kids off to see Kung Fu Panda. Go with them. I think it's one of those rare movies like The Incredibles and Finding Nemo that adults can enjoy as much as the kids.\n",
            "First I need to make it clear that since I was born and grew up in China, this review might be biased because there is so much more I appreciate from the movie, given my cultural background.<br/><br/>There is a specific category in the Chinese literature history called Kung Fu fictions and it had spread among generations currently between 12 - 60 years old. Have to admit, this movie touched deeply on that, far more than any Jackie Chan or Jet Lee movies. Because it is animated, it leaves more rooms for imaginations.<br/><br/>I am very satisfied with the movie, though I watched it with my American-born kids. It is still a typical Hollywood production, but somehow, it touched my Chinese heart.<br/><br/>It is a simple story, yet deep. See it if you haven't already.\n",
            "I Love it! The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. This original story is one of the best since Shrek. And the meaning behind the story may be even better! The story is about Po, an overweight panda who is the son of a noodle maker, who dreams of Po following in his footsteps. But Po longs to be a ninja fighter. Po is as you know is a panda bear and the film's unlikely hero: as the bigger than life and completely lovable bear voiced by the comic genius Jack Black. Po is a Sweet but clumsy, bear who hears the news the ancient and long awaited dragon warrior will be named, so he runs (as much as he can) to hear who will be named at the celebration.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, when an \"accident\" seems to name Po as the dragon warrior (much to the horror of Master Shifu (voiced perfectly by Dustin Hoffman) and the disappointment of Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross) and Monkey (Jackie Chan). Shifu must find a way to train him. One hilarious moment after another continues until Shifu recognizes Po's true driving force. This is just in time as the villain Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a snow leopard has returned as he believe is the true Dragon Warrior.<br/><br/>I can not recommend this movie enough. Certainly this is marketed for the kids  but the whole family will enjoy it.\n",
            "What a fabulous movie...great output from Dreamworks...This is the film, can be watched by all section of audience...very entertaining...The artists selection was too good....Jack Black the real show stealer...I don't think there was any expectations about this movie before release, but if you go with high expectations, definitely it reaches beyond.<br/><br/>The story as follows, Po(Jack Black),a panda who helps his father make and serve noodle soup. One day,an ancient tortoise named Oogway believes that Po is the Dragon Warrior. Po can't believe it, and neither does Master Shifu(Dustin Hoffman). When Master Shifu learns that a certain evil villain named Tai Lung escapes from prison, trains Po to defeat Tai Lung.<br/><br/>Don't miss this movie at any cost. Kudos to the makers. 2nd part is on the way, hope that will be a stunner than this part.\n",
            "I LOVED this movie!!!! I even daresay that this is the best animated motion picture I have seen since \"Cars\" two years ago. Although the whole story of an underdog turned champion is admittedly an oft-told retread, the treatment is original and amazing and very engaging, and not corny (unlike a lot of the recent animated films). I cannot stop singing praises to this one. The artwork of the whole movie is fantastically rendered, no exquisite detail was spared in the scenery, the architecture and of course, the lead animal characters.<br/><br/>The action and fight scenes are very well done and memorable. I enjoyed watching the fight scene between Po and Shifu for the last dumpling, the fight of the Five vs. Tai Lung at the Bridge, and the climactic fight scene of Tai Lung with Shifu, and then with Po. Very exciting. My daughter even spontaneously applauded after that last fight sequence.<br/><br/>There were also a number of beautifully-crafted emotional moments throughout. I loved the inspirational talk of Master Oogwei and Po (loved those words of wisdom), the talk of Master Oogwei and Shifu with the peach blossom petals, and of course the touching moment of Po and Shifu after the battle, and even in that small extra scene after the credits.<br/><br/>The voice acting was also very good. Jack Black as Po, so natural the comedian, wow. Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, really great. I did not expect it to be him. If was fun to discover after the movie that is was Angelina Jolie who voiced the Tigress, Lucy Liu, the Viper, and Jackie Chan, the Monkey, among others. And even more minor characters like the menacing head of prison security rhino Commander Vachir voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan, all very good.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic movie experience that I would not mind watching over and over. There is something for everyone -- action, drama, and comedy. It is an animated classic in my book. Very highly recommended indeed!\n",
            "When I watched the trailers to kung fu panda, I scoffed and sneered at the stupidity of a rude panda barging in and demanding to learn kung fu. If someone had asked me to go to that movie, I would have laughed in their faces, but gone anyway for the popcorn. As I watched the preview, I thought \"Well there's a waste of time and money, There's something I would never like.\" <br/><br/>...Boy was I wrong. Kung fu panda has splashes of children and adult humor, done by the perfect Jack black, who fit so well with Po, the roly poly, cuddly panda. The scenery was breathtaking, and most of the time I forgot that the majestic shimmering water and lovely smooth trees were fake! The Thins that most surprised me was all the heart put into it. On the previews they are targeting mostly youths and younger audiences with their humor, but really the thing that I found sweetest of all was all the heart. The moral was so touching and sweet, that I could have never expected Dreamworks to pull it off, after their recent garbage like \"Over the Hedge\" \"Shark Tale\" and others.<br/><br/>The scenery was beautiful, and the animation was outstanding! The characters fit so well with their voices, especially my all time favorite character Master Shifu voiced by Dustin Hoffman. True, Jackie Chan and the furious five didn't have too many lines, but this does not stop the upbeat trhill and flow of the movie. I am Definitely buying this movie the second it comes out on DVD, and have seen it 7 times in the theater. The battle scenes are superb, and my entire family is getting sick of me talking about them. The storyline is very original, and bright, but within all the humor there is a heart, and other emotions,such as sadness. One of my favorite scenes is the one in which the Brave Master Shifu battles with his former pupil, the vicious (and I mean vicious) Tai Lung.<br/><br/>All the characters add their own little sparkle to the story, like sweetness being added to a cake. I really can't express my utter love for kung fu panda-It would be like trying to type out love, or music- it just can't be done. <br/><br/>Sincerely, Piggypony\n",
            "I can't exactly describe my feelings when I first saw this movie yesterday. It's awesome. The dreamworks has done really a good job in expressing Chinese cultural elements! It made me and my friends and all the audience laughed from the beginning to the end. When the movie came to its end, 90% of the audience didn't leave the room as usual. They stayed until the HP picture came out! Every scene is so precious and lovely that everyone didn't want to miss it! As a Chinese citizen, my feelings are complicated when I saw that the culture are so nicely expressed on screen by some foreign movie makers, but it's good, isn't it? Chinese movie makers should learn a lot from Hollywood.<br/><br/>I think Kung Fu Panda perfectly gets together several important Chinese cultural elements: traditional Chinese Kung Fu Tactics, traditional Chinese fighting story, traditional Chinese jokes, traditional Chinese scenes, traditional Chinese music, even traditional Chinese legends! I also like the song after the movie.<br/><br/>Thank you, Dreamworks!! I'm seriously considering to go to see it for the third time!\n",
            "There have been many films about China that the Chinese themselves didn't like. They didn't like Disney's \"Mulan\", they didn't like \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\". This list goes on. Westerners have westernized the stories or included elements culturally offensive or unintelligible, and humour that, in the Orient, just isn't funny. Well, all that has changed. Last night I went to see Kung Fu Panda in Shanghai (in English with Chinese subtitles). Shangahai is the biggest city in China. The cinema was packed. And from start to finish there was non-stop laughter, excitement, and joy. The humour was universally funny, the culture was dead-on, and the story hit home with the Chinese. They could relate to the characters and their situations. They laughed. They laughed until they cried. Visually, the movie was just beautiful to look at. As an adult, I usually don't enjoy watching cartoons. But this one was more fun I've had at the movies in a long time. The timing of the film's release with the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing coming up is perfect. A job well done to all involved with the making of this little gem!\n",
            "My opinion:-- KungFuPanda is the best animated movie so far. I have seen almost all of them (toystory,incredibles,ratatullie,shrek,iceAge you name it). But KungFuPanda beats all of them. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It made us laugh like anything. Very good comedy scenes, well crafted anime art, Good action sequences, good Chinese landscapes, and very well told story. The screenplay is great. Special mention to the voices. Jack Black Rocks !! He blends into PO as if he was born to voice for PO. Dustin Hoffman suits perfect for Master Shifu. Dreamworks has surprisingly given an awesome anime picture. <br/><br/>My 10 out of 10. I'm gonna watch this movie again. <br/><br/>Highly Recommended.\n",
            "I enjoyed this movie a lot. Funny from beginning to end. Great special effects and animation. Engaging story and great voice acting. Jack Black really pulled it off and the complementing voices of Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan really made this film shine.<br/><br/>Jack Black brings his characteristic humor to this movie with great lines such as \"There is no charge for awesomeness, and attractiveness.\" and a general style that makes him...Jack Black!<br/><br/>The story was not only engaging but had real life lessons that are good for anyone to learn. It gave what seems like a child movie some depth. It might not change your life, but it sure is worth the $9.50 price of admission where I go to watch it.\n",
            "It seems like this is a movie made for all the fanboys out there,  regardless of what their obsessions are about. You know, being one who  idolizes certain somebodies or some things, and given a day that Fate  decides to throw you a curveball and give you that one opportunity to  come up close and personal to meet and greet your idol in the flesh, or  be thrown into the exact situation that you've always been dreaming  about. What would you do, and would you go weak in the knees or be  overcome with disbelief that you're actually, finally, realizing your  dream?  Panda Po (voiced by comedian Jack Black) epitomizes exactly that in  Kung Fu Panda, and that struck a chord in me and with many in the  audience as well. And for that, no matter how cliché the story would  become, it had already done its deal and made the connection. It is no  wonder it is rated G here, and I expect that the holiday season would  allow cash registers to ring, for animation fans with the different  styles utilized to tell the story (you must be on time and not miss the  opening sequence), for kung fu fans to get a kick out of classic kung  fu moves personified in their animal forms - Tigress (Angelina Jolie),  Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey  (Jackie Chan) - collectively known as the Fearsome/Fab Five, and for  the kids, given the obvious reason that hey, the protagonist is a  cuddly bear. The marketing department, if not already done, should  stock up on the plush toys, not only of the hero, but the supporting  casts as well. And make their younger forms available too, for they  will sell.  Story-wise, I can't help but to note its tip of its hat towards the  Jackie Chan martial arts movie of the past like Snake in Eagle's  Shadow, Eagle Shadow Fist, etc. The formula which follows a misfit with  weak or zero martial arts background having to undergo harsh training  under a kung fu master, finally realizing his true calling in time to  defeat the villain everybody fears. With the Jackie Chan movies, the  demise of loved one always trigger off a chain reaction, but since this  is G-rated, you won't have the pleasure of having blood spilled, but  with so many splatter-type movies in recent times, I have to admit this  was refreshing, and even having animated animals that talked, didn't  irk me as they are just so lovable here, in their own right.  It's an excellent and very even mix of comedy and drama, even though  they are quite cliché at times if you grew up with the formula, but I  thought that was the point. While the trailers might have given away  some stuff, there are still lots more available which are hidden up the  sleeves, and some minor word replacement such as \"suck\" to \"stink\",  though you would likely be able to stay a step ahead throughout and  even guess whatever secrets the movie have, actually are. For its  stylistic training sequences, they became a throwback and a link to the  fore-mentioned Jackie Chan movies. The fight choreography isn't done  shoddily too with its designing of fights true to the characters'  forms, and integrating them all in a manner rarely seen before. Since  it's an animated flick, it was able to, and probably ramped up  whatever's possible in the kung fu fantasy realm, to give us everything  from rooftop flights to an incredible prison break. It didn't waste any  effort in tapping from the wealth of kung fu material, what with the  various names of deadly moves, secret manuals,  teacher-student feuds, and the best part of it all? Humour being quite  unexpectedly well placed, with more hits than misses to break out into  a hearty laugh by the panda antics.  For all its A-list voice actors in the movie, with the likes of Michael  Clarke Duncan, Dan Fogler, Ian McShane and those who provide voices to  the 5 key animals, Kung Fu Panda is clearly a Jack Black and Dustin  Hoffman vehicle. The bantering between the two is priceless as the  latter plays Sifu (duh) the master teacher, a highly-strung and serious  character who has a past they are shameful about (don't they all). And  as his own teacher Oogway (read: Wu Gui, aka tortoise, voiced by  Randall Duk Kim) advises, herein lies an opportunity for Sifu to  rediscover himself when training possibly the next-big-thing (pardon  the pun) Po, whom he foretold as the mythical Dragon Warrior. So begins  the forging of friendship, long lasting bonds and trust between the  two, even though they got off the wrong footing. And you can probably  feel for Po, because for a fanboy type, having your idols scoff at you  at first opportunity, is actually quite painful.  As a kids movie, there's almost always a message to take away. Here,  it's a reminder to believe in oneself, which I guess is a universal  theme to instill some confidence in the young ones. You might not look  the best, nor are the best amongst your peers, but so long as you have  that attitude to want to learn, that should put you in good steed. As a  summer blockbuster movie, it's fun, thoroughly entertaining, and  doesn't try to be too smart. It's likely to be a crowd pleaser across  all age demographics, and an ultimate popcorn fare, so long as you  manage to keep the popcorn away from the thieving hands of the panda.  And with this release beating local film Kung Fu Gecko to the screens,  I wonder what's the status currently on the Nickson Fong project.\n",
            "My boyfriend and I had to choose between this movie and the Zohan. Needless to say we were both glad we chose Kung Fu Panda. I would rather have sat through this movie with a bunch of rambunctious kids than an action thriller with a bunch of obnoxious teens. The animation was up several levels by entertaining the adults with fast paced action segments speckled with the genius humor of Jack Black. There was so much of this movie that no one but Jack Black could pull off. The special and sound effects were better, in my opinion, than Ratatouille. The dishes clanking, the light shining off metal objects..fabulous. Town characters were enjoyable, cute and entertaining for the little ones...and it was a refreshing time to see so many adults relax and laugh as heartily as the little ones. The scenery was at times so realistic and breathtaking. Yes...the \"skadoosh\" segment was hilarious. As were many other points in the movie. The voice cast was wonderful. Clark Duncan was intimidating, funny, and I think the little ones were endeared to him even though he was a big burly character. Hoffman..wow...several times I had to remind myself it was his voice. I really hope there is a sequel...I bet millions of kids will hope so too.\n",
            "This is just the sweet spot you want - animation perfection coupled with a fine story that delivers an extremely enjoyable, very funny lovely gum drop of a film.<br/><br/>I think Dreamworks has easily surpassed Shrek (the first) with Kung Fu Panda. \"Shrek\" was great, but had so many puns because of the content (Fairy Tales) that it was almost too easy.<br/><br/>With the law-of-diminishing returns Shreks and the passably funny Madagascar under their belt, I had low expectations for \"Kung Fu Panda.\" Pleasant surprise is an understatement: the animators, screenwriters, storytellers, voice actors, and producers all brought their \"A game\" to this one. This should be considered at the very least a CGI animation and at worst a top 30 animation classic up there with the best from Disney and Pixar. I'd rate it very close to my Pixar favorites, \"The Incredibles,\" and \"Monsters, Inc.\" I won't bother regurgitating the highlights of the plot - others have taken care of that. It's the quality of this movie that's stuck with me; e.g., more laugh-out-loud hilarious moments than I can possibly remember, the tightly woven plot, and the simple, yet powerful message that isn't weighted down with too much sentimentality. I was also drawn unexpectedly to the animation itself - it has such a strong, unique use of color I found that the palette was another element that lifted the film out of the ordinary dreck of CGI. <br/><br/>This is just a great, fun, and very funny movie that is completely worth bringing the whole family to. Don't miss it.\n",
            "KungFu Panda is a cartoon and adventure movie! This movie is popular all over the world.Not only children like it, there are many teenagers that like it too. This movie is also very popular in Korea.<br/><br/>The Korean singer Rain is the vocalist for the soundtrack. So many Rain's fans are going to watch this movie. I think it is a good idea to make this movie popular all over the world.<br/><br/>I also like this movie very much. I hope this movie becomes a very famous movie!<br/><br/>I had already seen this movie,too. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be. It is very interesting and exiting! I think it is a better than any other cartoon movies.\n",
            "When a layperson is introduced to the opus of Chinese Martial Arts, the animals,birds and insects commonly present in fighting techniques are Tiger,Snake,Monkey,Leopard,Crane,Mantis,Eagle,Horse,Tortoise,10000 bees,Centipede,Scorpion,Gecko,Toad and several other relatively unknown styles.<br/><br/>There's also the mythical Dragon style.<br/><br/>But Panda ? No buddy, there's no Panda.<br/><br/>And that's specifically the reason I loved this movie.<br/><br/>The giant, lazy, slow animal ( Giant Panda ) with it's affinity for food ,having probably the least chance to make it up to Kung-Fu ranks, becomes a hero in this incredible movie.And his master 'Shifu' is a small Red Panda !!But don't get me wrong.Not by magic.The Giant Panda is a large animal with considerable strength and it can be fast when needed.<br/><br/>Po the Giant Panda was unexpectedly chosen by Tortoise guru Oogway to defend their valley from the wrath of the snow leopard 'Tai Lung' who was raised by Kung-Fu master Shifu, who is a Red Panda himself.<br/><br/>Shifu has five of the best as his students: Tiger, Viper, Crane,Monkey and Mantis.But not one of them, or even, all of them together can defeat the Snow Leopard who used to be the best and most powerful of all of Shifu's students.Sadly 'Tai Lung''s lust for power turned him into a merciless outlaw.Only with the help of Tortoise Guru ( Shifu's master )'Oogway' could Tai Lung be sent into Prison.<br/><br/>However Tai Lung breaks prison in an outstanding animation sequence that can compare with Hollywood's best action scenes, and is slated to come back to the valley and wreak havoc in his quest for a 'Secret' power.<br/><br/>And now according to Oogway, only the gentle Panda 'Po'( with enough theoretical, bookish knowledge but no Real Kung-Fu experience ) can stop him,and Shifu has to train him in unconventional ways.<br/><br/>Watch this movie with your entire family and you will love every second of it.<br/><br/>The climax could have been more gripping.Even then, for innovation, a 10 out of 10.\n",
            "I was surprised at how good this movie really was. The level of detail that DreamWorks has put into the animation is beyond me, and it has gotten even better with each movie.<br/><br/>Being a kung fu movie, the action is nothing to scoff at either. Every fight scene is special in its own way, and I love that the characters all have their own unique fighting style.<br/><br/>The music to the movie is absolutely amazing! Hans Zimmer and John Powell truly did an incredible job bringing this movie to life with its score. I take my hat off to them both.<br/><br/>If you love animated movies and you still haven't seen Kung Fu Panda, or any of its sequels, then I highly recommend it. I promise you won't be disappointed.\n",
            "This movie always holds up, no matter how many times I've watched it. The main character is hilarious - Jack Black is the perfect voice for him. Highly recommend it to anyone!\n",
            "Kung Fu Panda is one of the best animation movie I have ever seen. It has excellent animation; everything seems so realistic. The voice for the characters were a perfect match for in the movie. Throughout the movie, there are many scenes where you laugh until you can't anymore.<br/><br/>The story line was pretty good. It is just like any other animation movie. The only thing that sets this movie different from others is the laughter, adventure, and kung fu style.<br/><br/>This is a great family movie, but I suggest about letting little kids watching it because of the kung fu, action fighting thing. Other than that, its a great movie for kids and adults too. You'll love it until the end and will want to watch it again. It will definitely be worth your while.\n",
            "I found this movie to have a perfect combination of humor, hilarious situations and great graphics. I've seen it several times already, I still laugh during the movie, even though I know what to expect. It's just too funny not to laugh! It's one of those movies you can switch to if you don't like the movie you're watching. A guaranteed 1.5 hours of laughter! It deserves a 9+ rating, at least. It's difficult to envision what kind of person would not enjoy this film. Most of the good jokes require some mental abilities, so I assume somebody with a low IQ will not find this movie too interesting (hence the &lt; 8 ratings?). It's smart, it's funny, it's awesome!<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Madagascar, Shrek, Surf's Up or Happy Feet, you will love Kung Fu Panda!\n",
            "I was ready to see this film and anticipating it for months, and it delivered. Although some will say that it could have been funnier, I was pleased and laughed hard throughout. It is full of great voice talents that make the characters shine; even characters that are only there for a small amount of time.<br/><br/>In the first two minutes of the film there is a dream sequence that is laugh out loud hysterical! I was practically crying; and turned to my friend to tell her, \"That was worth the price of admission, alone.\" Jack Black makes a great voice and really brings the fat panda to life. He has just the right amount of comic relief and seriousness to make you connect with his character and really believe in him.<br/><br/>Everyone I was with laughed hard and left with a smile on their face. I will definitely put this one in my list of movies to buy on DVD.\n",
            "0  Maybe I missed something in this movie, but I thought it was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite some time.\n",
            "1 At least for adults.\n",
            "2 True, there were a few cute jokes, but how many jokes can be done at the expense of the panda being fat and flabby before the audience, even children, say Okay, we got it.\n",
            "3 The theater was about 2/3 full and for most of this movie people were getting up to leave; adults and children.\n",
            "4 A man a few seats down was snoring, which was one of the more entertaining aspects of this movie.\n",
            "5 Some of the dialogue was muddled and some of the action so fast it was hard to keep up and not get a headache.\n",
            "6 It had a nice basic plot, which was okay, but there were aspects of this movie that were not fully developed, and this included character development.\n",
            "7 For example, when Po asks his dad if he's really his dad (since the dad was a duck).\n",
            "8 I would have liked to see more development of the main characters, other than Hoffman's, as that would have at least added something to the movie for the adults.\n",
            "9 And apparently not too many kids liked this movie either, at least on the day we went, since throughout the entire movie they were talking, and not about the movie.\n",
            "10 And for the most part, the voices for each character fit, but Black's voice for Po just did not work well for the personality for the character on screen.\n",
            "11 It seemed like Black was holding back, which is too bad, since, like Robin Williams, for example, you let them go and what comes out is pure magic.\n",
            "12 Even in animation and the dialogue is more scripted.\n",
            "13 My wife and I watched the Blu-Ray DVD of Kung Fu Panda for 30 minutes but could not take any more of it.\n",
            "14 This is, without doubt, one of the absolute worst animated features we have ever seen.\n",
            "15 It's a real snoozer -- not the least bit funny or entertaining.<br/><br/>So much top-notch talent was wasted on the weak storyline and pathetically bad dialog!\n",
            "16 It's hard to believe that this second-rate production came from Dreamworks Animation, the studio that created the fabulous Shrek.\n",
            "17 The animation is mediocre and seems amateurish in comparison to any Shrek feature or Pixar film of the past decade (Nemo, Cars, Wall-E, Ratatouille, Monsters Inc., Toy Story, etc.\n",
